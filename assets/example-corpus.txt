aw yeah



awwww yeeahhh



now is the time to mention that i recorded like an entire 45 minute video guide of the GUR speedrun like a year ago and i just forgot to put it on youtube so now its lost



rest in pepperonis



:suspensive:



it would've been semi-outdated by now anyway



still a good baseline nonetheless



actually i just realized



now that we have a swf download is it possible to decompile swfs



and get game code



👀



because i want to look at how the grapple physics code works



that shit does not make any sense



tru



what do you mean specifically?



like the spring on 25?



how speed is manipulated when you move the grapple up/down



not spring but you know what i mean



or move using the grapple



ahh



how the velocity is calculated



that way it becomes easier to optimize certain parts of the game



like 36



or TAS 👀



that would probably take a long time



yeah



fun fact



just over 2 1/2 years of speedrunning the game



on and off



still havent gotten a deathless run



feelsbadman



i have gotten precisely 1



dude same



you could probably get a really slow deathless run if you wanted



well



i want a fast deathless run



dont we all



i want 3:46



lol



rn i feel like somewhere around 3:43 is limit w my current strats



same



3-5 secs faster than current WR



is reasonable



nice flex



nah jk



i couldve said 'my epic run' but i said 'current wr'



lol



lmao



2:27 is def a possible 40 time



oh yeah



my 20-30 was slow iirc



and 30-40 was okay



like 2:31



ur 41-50 was so good



theres no way im beating my 50



probably near-optimal



nah i messed up once on 44



@cyclowns apparently it might be possible to "decompile" .swf files according to some really sketch websites



and 46 can be faster with the vertical speed trick that you use on 24



really sketch websites are the best tho



i found a swf decompiler



i dont know to what extent it works



im gonna try it out



it says you can get out actionscript files + assets



if thats true then that would be cool



i should start running again



yea it's actually been nice for me



alright, board room meeting



how do we get the youth to speedrun give up robot



1 day of derust and then i've already gotten some decent 40s



we rename new game



to fortnite%



problem solved



that reminds me the hard game wr is insane



dude



yeah hard game wr is nuts



i tried to grind hard mode like a couple months ago



the wr is so fucking crazy



i just gave up because i didnt feel like grinding that hard for it



Joined the server.



hello, im an epic gamer looking to run some speed 😎



nice



cyclowns what's your hard mode pb



uhh



like high 2 minutes



ah



or low 3 minutes



i dont remember



safe for now



xD



pretty sure i haven't even beaten hard



have any of you played give up robot 2



yes



tried once



had the wr



for a day



it was actually pretty fun but its not as active as gur1 for speedrunning



i beat it and the hard mode a couple of times



i remember needing to actually think so i gave up



it seems like a pretty unoptimized game as far as i can tell rn



its not AS fun to speedrun



because of the rockets and stuff



imo



agreed



and the boss sections



i hated those



it worked



i now have GUR assets

not entirely sure how legal this is



3 legal



Joined the server.



Anyone knows what language it is? Kinda looks like C++ or JavaScript
I guess most Flash games or made in JavaScript, but I'm not that into these stuff

Thought that TAS idea sounded fun and wanted to try even tho I won't succeed



its actionscript, oracle's own proprietary language for flash development



its similar in syntax and design to java and javascript



if you can read/code in both then actionscript is pretty easy



Yeah, I did some digging and found that as well. Thank you

The problem only comes with all the safety checks they have, I'll try to figure this out.



im pretty sure there are tools out there to tas flash games



im not sure how they work but they exist



Well that would make it so much easier



cause i've seen TASes of that one flash portal game made with it



not sure how difficult TASing give up robot would be



Probably pretty hard, but it's a fun thing to play around with. To get a theoretical best



if i can minmax how the grapple physics works then a TAS could potentially be VERY fast if it was optimized



because grappling is super weird and if you can increase/control your speed or do the vertical momentum glitch thing at any moment because of frame-perfect inputs then you can probably get mega speed



Yeah, could probably build those glitched speeds on top of each other somehow. This is worth digging into



applicability in RTA is potentially iffy because grapple physics is REALLY unreliable

this took me like a couple dozen tries to get once



That's a good time save, do you slow down in the beginning to get a longer grapple further in the back?



i have no idea what i did



arcane wizardry at this point to try and replicate it



i tried like 20 different setups and none of them worked the same



my idea was that if i get the longest grapple possible as far along the top brick as possible



and then extend my grapple until the brick starts falling



then i could clear the gap



but knowing when to release the grapple/how fast to swing/when to grapple initially is difficult



It's probability impossible to pull it off consistently

The only way I've successfully done it is if you really take it slow and are barely moving forward when you catch it. But then there is no time save

you can also do it this way



Not sure how much time that one saves



Even with that setup though i’m still too inconsistent with that strat though



yes it might not save as much as the other strategy, but if you want it for the looks, it sure is more consistent 😆



Trutru



Just wished that other 36 strat was viable but my consistency on that was j not improving no matter how much practice



yeah I've had the same issues with the 46 skip



So lately we've found a lot of 'shortcuts', David found some amazing ones, and you @rtdrtd67 have found some really great ones as well. That 24 glitch is game breaking. But level 29, why is there no recording of that one. Is it to unconsistent to pull of in a run and doesn't save enough time to be talked about?



Or have I only missed it maybe



What shortcut are you talking about?



ah, nevermind. couldnt think of which level you were talking about. do you mean the shortcut where you keep grappled on the top and swing all the way across the middle in 1 swing?



Yes, exactly, that one. I mean that must be some time save right?
Or is it just an illusion and is actually slower



it saves time but it is EXTREMELY difficult to pull off and definitely not viable in a run

here is a video of the skip by the hard mode wr holder



but he makes it look easy. if you touch the far right wall you get completely stuck to it for some reason.



Ahhh, I just missed it then

There is a segment run section in speedrun.com right?

Can't we just add the shortcuts of levels we know there, so that players have a faster and easier way to getting to see them?



i dont know of such a section. some of the skips have been posted in the guides section of the GUR src page (not here yet) and some have been posted in the forum on src. I believe cyclowns does most of these strategies in his wr (with a few exceptions of course) so his wr would be a good start if you want to find some strats.



I ment the level leaderboard.



ohhh



Thanks, but im not that good at running, mostly into finnding the perfect time



I meant something like this, just a really fast showcase so isnt optimized

i dont think there would be much point having a level leaderboard since once you complete a level you cant go back to it.



if there were a level leaderboard it would probably be 10 level segments (1-10, 11-20, etc.)



true true, well as long as shortcuts are avalible for everyone to see in a easy matter, fair game. As they are now



they are available, but not very well organized. we can work on that in the future.



oops, i linked the entire program, sorry



yes, thank you, thats what i ment



i've made a video where you can see the different places you're able to use the same trick as level 24

So this video is me finding (all the) places where you use the same gamemechanic speedrunners use on level 24. I chose not to include level 24 and level 46, since there is already video of the 2. There might be more places to do it, the one I find most likely is on level 15.  ...
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBsFh6NO2pI/maxresdefault.jpg



there's more info in the describtion



16 and 43 looked like some pretty decent saves on both of them



oh yeah damn



i totally forgot 43



if you can pull it off yeah



If you can pull that 43 of it would be really good, next to imposible tho



exactly



but idk why I just feel like i've seen it before



Well it kinda looks like the trick on 46 I guess



yeah it's probably there I thought I've seen it



probably, great work though



Thank you so much



This took fucking forever to record ahahaha



yeah, I saw that the timer had been ticking for a LOONG time



have pulling 43 off in a run LOL



ahahah don't get fooled by the timer i left my computer with it accidentally running



but i mean the entire evening yesterday



and some of today has just been me atempting, recording, editing



Yeah, no human can ever make all these things work, if you're not one of those crazy mario runners that play 24/7 and get lucky



AHHHHhhhh, you really find a lot of exploits, put a lot of effort into it



^-^ thank youuu



its possible on 46 too



that's one of the most useful omes imo



i vote we call that trick hyperspeed grappling



o u have 46 in description



I made a small change in the program for you guys that really want to find the fastest time to clare each level. The timer in the back resets every time you start a new level or die. Nothing big but its a lot easier to know how long it takes to complete each level now

It's just for training, wont acctuly calculate the total time



here is an alternative version, It's just a tad more accurate at the expense of a hole lot of time and you need to do some calculations yourself

haven't worked out a way to compine the two or make them better because I'm really really bad at this and my decompiler is probably worse. If there is any need or anything i can try, but don't think they'll be used to much



hyperspeed grappling, I like that



gonna see if i can make a practice SWF where you can teleport to each level



so you can actually practice ILs



that would be sick



@SensualPudding how'd you recompile into an SWF after you edited the actionscript



not sure if i can just recompile it normally and have it work



or if i need to do something special



I just used a program for it



Can make it to EXE and FLA as well using that



Why? Anything special you are onto?



Did solve it so that you get something like this after each stage to see your time, and speeded up the time its on screen. Gave up after that tho, didn't really want to put the effort in to add like a ghost of your fastest time or an recorder

now when change is viable that a poibility tho if anyone is a faster programmer then me. I dont know, It probably wouldn't have a use outside practicing but i get stuck in small projekts like that



replay or level selection for practice, that would be great. we aren't a big comunity so no use, but fun

The thing I hate the most about Give up, Robot
anyone who knows why this happens and how not to succ like I do

when I press jump nothing happens, he just strolls into the nothingness
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rkjveYjr6Wo/maxresdefault.jpg



anyone who knows wtf this is



it only happened a few times (and on some pretty tight windows too) so I think you just missed the jumps.



yeah okay



btw has anyone made a TAS of this game?



btw @hetheis i did a rough timing of 16 and though ur strat of instantly getting to 3rd plat is rly cool it seems to actually be about the same or slower than the normal strat



Yeah, I got it to be slower as well



But it was something I hadn't thought about so a nice find



oh, ahahah I might have compared it to my own times, but I mean if someone likes the finesse from my strat they should do it 😉



I didn't really understand how it worked so I got it to a consistently ~0.4 sec slower



@SensualPudding do you have the SWF for the time after level thing



i'm gonna see if i can build off of it and make a level teleport thing



+ add a key to restart a level or something



Yup, I have it at my computer



I can send it when I get home in like an hour, okay



rad, thanks



Probably not that hard to make a restart and level select, there is already a veritable for that and stuff. Just need to add an inputbox



yeah i was thinking like



R to restart level (just killbind)



G to open level teleport input box



Yes, exactly. The restart is going to be real easy. I don't know how to make an input box in actionscript tho so that's i didn't do it, didn't have time to search



might not end up with an input box



Levelselection could be a picture of the level so you don't have to know them by heart as well



could just print text to the screen



Yup, just realised that there wasn't a need for that, could just be like buttons or something easy



i have no idea how you can get the swf to recompile



i add like 5 lines of pcode to the player file and suddenly the game completely breaks when i try to enter a level



and even when i delete the code it still doesnt work



Yeah, that happened to me for a while as well. I can't add code, just moved, replaced or deleted code. They probably have some kind of checker somewhere



whats swf?



shockwave flash file



its just a compiled form of the game



that you can run offline



how do you get it



there's a download on the speedrun.com resources page



for gur

i could add code to Main.as



because im trying to add a new input handler



but not any other files ive tried



Or just look at the scorcecode of any game in a website if you want another game, it's all there. Just a link that ends with  .swf



I just had a problem with the player class.



Could only add one time, after the it always reported errors



that gives me an idea



i'm gonna rip the SWF from the blipz.weebly page since it doesnt have any of the adultswim stuff



maybe theres code in there thats mucking it up



Ahh, could be



And it's annoying as fuck



so i have downloaded the folder from the website but i cant open the file, I dont have a program to do



the swf file?



yes



Just download a swf viewer



you can get it here



https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html



its called "flash player projector content debugger"



aight thanks



or at least thats the one i use



heres a SWF download that doesnt have any adultswim stuff

yeah there's defenetly some checkers



thats odd



which one of the thousand links do I press?'



flash player content debugger



or w/e is similar to that



i might be able to rip the domain checker out of it



somehow



here's my quickly put together time thing you asked for btw

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/691378061144227850/GUR_Time.swf

lol did it

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/691378632853160027/unknown.png



it was actually super easy to just remove the code for the domain checker



nice, how did you do it?



it was just one if statement in MainMenu.as



so i just deleted the pcode for it



and it worked fine



ahhhh, easier then i expected. nice work



@merpell could you add this swf to the resources page on speedrun.com

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/691378995752861737/GiveUpRobotNoAdultSwim.swf



its the same SWF but without the adultswim stuff



so it loads quicker and what not



when i download the link from speedrun.com its an adobe acrobat document



might just be your computer getting confused



cause its an swf



when i try to download the files you've sent here it says the might damage my computer



it won't, its just an swf



can't really do anything except get played by adobe flash



that's downloaded ad an adobe acrobat documen taswell



it'll say its an acrobat document but its not



idk why it says that



you can still run it in the offline flash player



lets go champ, it finally worked



and this counts as speedrun attempts?



yeah



its the same game



as long as you dont mess with the code



everyone will have to run it like this eventually anyway



even though you spiced up the code a little?



because web flash is dying



if you're using mine its still fine



i didnt edit any game code



but i guess thats up to merpell and jumpyluff to decide



not me



yeah okay, i downloaded the messege, where merpell is tagged



yeah that ones basically the same one as on blipz.weebly.com



but with code edited to make it run properly



ok, that's the one I use normally



did you use this program for your WR?



no, i used the website version



it would work the same though



the offline player might actually be faster in some circumstances



because it doesnt have browser bloat or whatever



yeah it's just, when I watch your WR the gameplay itself looks much smoother than when i play on blipz, but I can see a better "smoothness" when I use this



it has to do with your computer and browser



when i run blipz on firefox on my linux install it runs super slowly and i have no idea why



but i switch to chrome and it works fine



and when i run it offline it runs fast too



ok, but thank you so much btw with this



alright i managed to get a restart bind working by moving the input checks to Level.as update() instead of player



so note to self Player.as is cursed do not edit it

{Reactions} 


ahh, nicely done, that will make everything so much easier with playing stuff



@cyclowns you want me to credit you as the author?



if you want



your choice



sure i guess



you have to upload a compressed folder rip



i mean you can just zip it and add it



or i can upload a zip here



no i know



im just saying



ah



a direct upload would have been much nicer



but oh well



its kinda annoying to have to upload zips



yeah



alright, its added



alright

here is the best practice swf yet



i havent added teleporting to levels yet



but you can press R to restart a level, deaths are faster so you can retry more often, at the end of every level it shows you your IL time (with no delays), and it doesnt have the adultswim stuff



im done for today



time to play minecraft for 8 hours because of the quarantine



cyclowns computer genius



round of applaus for cyclowns



@SensualPudding already had most of the work done for the IL times at the end of the level



kind of just a lot of copy paste and trial and error for the rest



But you put it all together and fixed the restart, nicely done



if i can finish the level teleport thing ill make a thread for it on the speedrun.com forum



Hmm i'm getting a "This file does not have an app associated with it for performing this action"



Prob just being dumb but i'm not rly sure how to fix



are you trying to just doubleclick it



you have to run it in flash player



^



i think i can actually export it as an .exe too?



so i could do that



how do i get flash outside of chrome



https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html



download the one called "flash player projector content debugger"



or something to that effect



^



and using it you can run .swf files outside of chrome



kk got it thanks



alright we're getting into ultimate nerdshit territory



i made a spreadsheet for IL split comparisons

if you want to use it just use the GUR IL swf and enter your time after every level



also in the process of testing it i found a bug in my practice swf which is that you can't play level 50 for some reason



so im gonna fix that later



the fastest times column is the level time data from @SensualPudding's https://www.speedrun.com/gur1/guide/lwfzz

Nicely done, good idea with importing directly from the game files as well. Probably not to hard, just in port it into a csv or something. The nerdyness of GYR went from 0 to a 100 real quick



What does the split section mean?



you enter the time you get after each level into there



it is manual which is annoying but



very useful for time comparisons



you could also change the 'fastest time' column to be your IL personal bests or whatever



All automatic, this is great. Applauds to you



it'd be better if it was in livesplit but i can't use livesplit on linux so



¯\_(ツ)_/¯



cant really test it



would be better, but excel can put in times automaticly from the game file a hell of a lot easier.



its not automatic from the game files if thats what you mean



you still have to input whatever time you got manually



but the differences and stuff is still automatic



I know I know, but could be done. CSV is pretty easy to handle



it's not something i'd use if i was doing actual runs, just if i was trying to make my IL times better



which is way easier now



In livesplit you have to know the hashes and stuff



yeah, only for potential bests



surprising amount of new stuff discovered since my WR



might start doing runs again



most of it I found in a 2 year old video, just put it all together so it could be found a bit easier



i need to get good at the hyperspeed grapples on 43 and 46



those can save a lot of time



plus the new trick on 22



and 29



the 46 one is surprisingly easy



ive done it a couple times before



the 43 one i've never tried but it looks harder



43 was defenetly harder, I'm not an experianced player but I do think it was a great deal harder than most of the other tricks



from my experience 43 is easier than 46



just can't get hang of 46 at all



Really?
Well we all have different fields
Just need to grab the block and the piller within the smallest window possible

there's more info in the description, even a possible timesave 👀



Nice, 2:05 was a good one. Maybe even the ~1:22 one. Don't know if it's faster though? You waste time to get there, do you earn enough time to get a faster time is the question. Think it maybe can be at 1:22,maybe. 2:05 is fast but a bit off course



Its a good waste of time during the quarantine 😁



After 1:22 it should be possible to squeeze in a high jump right into goal. If the window is way to tight it's maybe possible to clip out of the lower half instead of the top on 1:22. Could be a bit straighter maybe.

i got you, it's possible



That's amazing. Great job hetheis
That could possibly be a nice time save, don't know yet tho, maybe



Thanks, yeah I'm already grinding in the practise swf file cyclowns made 😉



Yeah, I'm curious to see how it works out



I'll keep you updated



Thanks



After some testing I'm pretty sure you loose more time than you gain. To bad, but maybe it can be perfected



yeah the best i was able to get was 6.10



Yeah, but it's a cool trick. And I bet it's possible to save time with it on other levels we haven't discovered yet



You Can do it for the looks thats for sure



Joined the server.



Hello



ay



didnt realize this was here til just now



got 8th a few hours ago



WOW congrats mate



whats the time?



4:30.22



6 deaths, fucked up 24 skip



but still hype



damn that's impressive gj



ty



im 21st 4.50



oh nice



my last verified run is 17th lol



that's a nice leap in the leaderboard



definitely



saved like 15 seconds over that run



there are a lot of swf files above in this chat you can download



one is where you can reset the level



you're on



oh that sounds helpful lmao



VERY ahahha



stuff like 41 and 43 are really really hard to practice



i still dont even try optimal 43 its ridiculous



those 2 are abnormally annoying



24 38 43 and 46 are all the worst



46 might just be me



what's 38 again?



the one with the giant shuriken spin into like a 2 tile wide gap



ohhh yeah



Do you use the strategy where you extend the grapple?



it's pretty consistent



oh nah ive just been lining myself up



about a tile away from the shuriken



then extending



i can get it like 3/4 of the time which is still way worse than most other levels

I beat my PB with 30 seconds "Give up, Robot" speedrun
I was so pumped on the last 10 levels
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FsvqNTezoTQ/maxresdefault.jpg



this is from my run



oh yea thats what ive been doing



but 46 is made for choking



i didnt even realize you could cling onto the right wall in my first playthrough



it took me like literally a day to beat with the speedrun strat lmao



on 38?



and yeah 46 is just complete jank



38 ye



i've never thought about that either



I grapple on level 8 sometimes



*9



ive been doing that consistently



it saves like a fifth of a second at best but it looks cool and its not hard



it's all for the looks



yea lmao

this trick aswell



I've done it in 6.10, about 1.5 seconds slow



but it looks badass



yeah i cannot be bothered to do more 24 strats



lmao



we actually named that trick 'hyperspeed grapple'



I've made a couple of videos where I showcase them on different levels



yea that makes sense



i saw you can save time by doing it in 46



but like



please god no



yeah that's way to difficult. Only if that's my last timesave I'll try it



i think i've gotten most of the big timesaves that aren't 50 skip



that new 22 skip looks easy enough though



yeah, no it's basically pixel perfect



but you dont die when you land on the shirukens



oh is it lmao



apparently not using the platform in 18 saves time? i started off doing the platform skip but i thought the generally used strat was just faster



cus no one was using platform skip and it really isnt hard



yeah that's way to clutch for me to do, I just use the platform



switching to using the platform was a pain i kept instinctually walking off the starting ground and panicking lmao



yeah the worst is forgetting what the level you are entering is like



yeah



hardly happens once you get shit down to a rhythm



but when you start implementing new shit it becomes an issue



ok yeah nvm this 22 skip is impossible lol



i get it as soon as i say that LMAO



You can actually do it 4 times on the level



got it 4 times in a row



still not suuper comfortable with it but its around 50/50 now



im willing to grind this out for the 3 seconds



minus the six deaths, 22 and 24 skip= new WR????



👀 👀 👀 👀



nah i dont do 50 skip



that saves like 20 seconds right



but someone who can do 50 skip could reasonably get wr if they did deathless with 22 skip



wr also doesnt do fast 41



he's in this server too



cyclowns ye



he's famous you know



If you want to save 20 seconds with 50 skip you gotta be either really bad without it. Or be a fucking god with the skip. And 22 is just a few seconds



Cyclowns has the world record not only because all the skips. But he does even the simplest levels a little faster, 30 or 40 of those little faster adds up

But yeah, a new record is possible with a lot to spare, but doesn't make it super easy



definitely not easy at all



But it's bound to happen, I'm not that good at the game, mostly likes the physics behind it. But you could go for it
10-20 hours and it's bound to happen



Just a bit tedious



10-20 hours is probably what i'll need to get 50 skip consistent enough to get it half the time



lmao



Yeah, that skip can be realllly hard, especially the second half



yeah the part with the 3 tiny gaps is horrible



i havent managed to do that once



but ive only tried for maybe half an hour total



You'll get therw



@Doggo Did you stop recording when the video ends or did you just cut it? I can't verify your run because the video doesn't actually show your final time.



oh shit whoops i went off of the audio cues on vegas



yeah i can reupload with the final time gimmie like 20 mins



Awesome



Take your time also. no rush for me



resubmitted



perfect, verified



👍



@Doggo welcome



grats on the run



ay thanks



50 skip is easily the hardest part of the entire run



its kind of a pain that its at the very end



definitely lmao



regular 50 is hard enough for me



kekw



lost what probably wouldve been like a 4:25 to the one tile grapple



that wouldve still been 8th lol but still



I lost a sub 4 to two 48 deaths



so it happens



yea nature of the game



exactamundo



i got a sub 4 one day i was grinding for wr



but i didn't submit it because it wasn't record



and i had like 3 more hours to grind anyway lol



lmao fair enough



ended up getting wr like 15 minutes after so good choice



PogU



i started practicing a bit again



i am not very good at some of the news skips



like the 43 hyperspeed grapple or the 29 swingy thing



yeah ive been getting confident enough with the 22 skip and thats probably as far as i can go



hyperspeed on 43 and 46 look wretched



ive never heard anything about 29

this is the one i mean



oh good lord



it's surprisingly hard



yea shit you cant hit the wall at all



crazy



i cant even do arcanod strats for 43 im not touching hyperspeed on that shit



its probably the one ill get good at last



only saves like a second i think



yeah i only practiced 24 hyperspeed cus it saves like four seconds



yeah



i think we've probably found most of the big timesaver skips at this point



skips for 39, 42, 45 would all be good



because those are the longest levels besides 50



and theyre all just fuckin screen scrollers



lmao yea



or sidescrollers whatever



45 is the only one that could really feasibly have one though



yeah



its definitely possible to have a TAS skip for 45



because you can hyperspeed grapple off of the moving block and get a ton of vertical momentum



it just usually rockets you into death



ye



I have litterally had 4 runs in last last our 5 seconds from a fuckng PB



KILL ME



literally just had another one



you love to see it



i finally beat that shit



only by 0.93 seconds



Kinda dont wanna submit



but it's 4:50 flat



fuck it I'm submitting



I have perhaps made the most CLUTCH save on level 50



nvm forget everything I just said my OBS screwed me over halfway through my recording it's lost



rip



feelsbadman



I mean the run itself was pretty horrendous



so it's not that bad, just pissed I can't show you guys my save



im quitting for today jesus christ



first run after i fix my shit and i miss the las tfucking box on level 50



that box gets so much smaller when you're on a fast run lol



sometimes i just look at the leaderboard and watch some of the runs to see if theres strats i miss and i always laugh at this one

random guy submits a 55th place run and misspells world record in the thumbnail



word record



and i was like same



word record



some of the submissions are hilarious



there was a guy who had the last place hard time for like 2 years



and i was looking at it



and it was on a hacked site



and i was like



"oh"



the current last place normal mode time is one of my favorite runs



dude has a stream setup and beautiful splits and voiceover and then its like a 9 minute time



i want him to keep running



and he just whispers 'easy' after every level



best run ever



lol



i have to watch



oh no i verified it



without watching



i am a bad mod



lol



i mean



imagine splicing your run just so you can get last place



i mean with the hard mode thing



ya never know



not that it matters of course



i need to setup splits and a keypress indicator thing still



idk how to setup livesplit so that i can enter splits manually because i tried it once and could not figure it out for some reason



i mean the game has splits built in



well yea



but i mean in a program like livesplit



i can show you if you want cyclowns



so that i can see sum of best and gold splits and stuff



livesplit does let you see your golds and stuff ig yea



sure



lemme actually download livesplit again



kekw



i might setup a give up robot splits file for the resources page



though its not like its any info you couldnt just put in yourself



god i have to remember how to setup igt lol



ah got it



oh yea ive gotten everything set up for rta runs but idk how you just type in your igt times for splits lmao



pretty splits

i think for gur you also need to edit manual game time in layout editor to accept split times and not segment times

did a random run to test it



nice flex



i had a really good 10-20 for some reason



the rest of it was ok



random run is 8th pogchamp



also 30.27 first 10 what happened?



i messed up level 1 lol



it wouldve been a low 28 if i didnt



classic



level 1 and level 50 are the 2 most annoying levels



yin and yang



confirmed



oh wow



my segment time for 10-20 was .22 faster than my WR segment time



lol



in that random run



1 is easily the hardest part of the run when you arent doing 50 skip lol



thankfully 1 is at the very beginning



so u can just reset if you dont get a good time



yeah if level 1 were in like 21-30 i wouldnt even try



its one of the most variable levels in the game



same with like



yeah a bad 1 is a massive timesink



43, 45, 50



and 20



compared to bad execution in other levels



45?



i count 45 because of the end



most people do it kind of slow



for some reason



probably cus one death at that part is instant reset



yea lol



and youre at the last split



you die at the end of 45 and you lose like 20 seconds



you die on like 41 and you lose 0.7 seconds



yeah thats why i try to do hyper 41



its inconsistent as fuck but one death is hardly a time loss compared to doing it slow



im not good at 41 for some reason



its definitely the hardest of the "lol go fast with shuriken" levels



of which theres like 6 for some reason



lmao when you think about it



theres like 3 in a row in the 20s



26-28 is a complete blur to me



matt thorson has definitely improved on their level design in towerfall and celeste



i dont even remember what they are i just remember the inputs to them by heart



same



26 is jump grapple go go gadget grapple extend then grab shuriken



27 is just grab shuriken



28 is jump grab block grab shuriken spin



oh yeah 28 is the one with the giant circle



So I'm sorry for bringing up a bit of old things here. But about the livesplit, is it only manual splits or there's automatic splits at sertain hashes?



im not aware of an autosplitter for the game



but i imagine it could be done



however i dont have the technical know-how to do so



Ah, so a manual were done. Yeah, can be done but I don't know livesplit at all so I don't know it either



Have to do something with cheatengine if I'm not mistaken



idk how to make an autosplitter but i could try



it's possible now that we have the offline flash



Yeah, worst case cenario it's possible to put it right into the code otherwise



A autosplitter would be nice to have



YOU ARE



KIDDING



JUST SPAGHETTID THE FUCK OUT OF A 4:12 HSDJVSCMDCSHN

nicee



are u doing runs with new 43/46 strats or nah



im doing 46



im not doing 43 because i tried for like an hour and only got it twice



so im just not consistent enough at it at all rn



lol how do u restart on the swf again



just try to open it again and it should restart



ie file in top bar



yea i just go to file and then select the swf again



^^^



i see thxthx



the only new strats im really doing are 22 and 46



for me 29 and 43 were too inconsistent



other than that im just getting better segments in general like 10-20



are u doing safe 22 or like instant fallthrough



also what's been ur best 20 time and 30 time



best 20 was like 54.3



best 30 i dont remember



i think like 1:36 something



i do the instant fall through if i can



if i dont get right on the yellow block i just do the safe method

🤙 Hey guys. I recognize almost all your names from the leaderboard



Just got a 4:06.92 tonight. Soo close to beating arcanod. How ya'll doin?



woah nice



no ones gotten below 4:20 ish in a while



Thanks 😄 Once I can get blockless level 50 consistently I'm hoping to get a sub 4



But we'll see about record, because your pb is so fuckin clean



nice run towny. you should have an easy sub 4 once you stop messing up on the freebies since you seem to have the hard tricks nailed. keep it up



Thanks! Yeah I tend to mess up little stuff, which does add up alot. I've only been running a few months, so muscle memory should improve soon



oh holy shit



grats man



im funny_dog_man on the lb btw, since im guessing im one of the few you dont recognize



I recognize you, your 3:39 video was funny as fuck



towny stop dying on 47 and beat me already jeez



lol that run had no business PBing. I gotta make a slow rise to the top, yknow, get people excited



did i fucking stutter

lol



LMAO I have no idea why 47 likes to fuck me



I'm going in the hyberbolic time chamber



you have literally submitted 3 runs in the past few days



and im pretty sure youve died on 47 in all 3



we need to code like a practice SWF that can select levels... Anyone good with flash?



I made a shitty newgrounds flash game in like 2005 but that's like my limit



actually laughed at 47



I lost 5 seconds trying to save that shit haha



@Towny i was working on that



level selector



Pog



That would be so fucking helpful. Being able to do the same level without resetting the game would be so useful for testing efficiency



did you see the practice SWFs



IL times + death keybind



not much yet but



Nope, are they on the resource page?



Oh, just scrolled up in the messages and found it



Cool shit, I thought individual level timers would be the hard part, but it's already working!



too easy for god cyclowns



Wish I could help out in some way. But I've been meaning to get back into flash, anyone know a good swf decompiler?



that part was galaxygamer, not me



i use jpexs



ffdec



it's ugly as sin but it works fine



the way the decompilation works you never actually decompile to AS and then edit it



you have to edit the swf directly (sort of) through ffdec and modify a bytecode-like thing to actually change the code



which is harder but



also gj beating arcanods time



Sounds a bit above my Roblox Lua scripting level of expertise, but I'll look into it



And thanks 😄 feels good to sit with the big boys now



theres an experimental feature to edit actionscript directly so it's not that hard



however you  cant edit everything



That's a seven year old record btw, pretty impressive for the strats he used



yeah



that was back in the days of SDA



arcanod is goat



tbh



arcanods was the one to beat for like 6 years



beforem erpell beat it



man that record timeline was fuckin wacky



- arcanod has record for 5 years
- merpell beats it with 50 skip
- i beat it 6 months later
- rtdrtd beats it literally 1 day after my record



haha I remember the comment on your pb was like "If this gets beat in a day again I'm quitting"



omg i forgot about that lol



dude i was like partying when i got wr



i just played give up robot in history class instead of doing work



I did the same in tech class in high school. Me and like 3 other dudes would crowd around 1 computer and play BM Tron. Teacher didn't give a fuck



How did you guys find out about GUR? I remember when Adult Swim aired the commercials for it



i sat at this table with 2 kids that constantly vaped in class and they told me about it



i mention that because they did literally no work and just played give up robot



found it on friv



those were the days



i think i found it in like middle school



Damn I'm showing my age, it came out when I was a sophomore in high school haha



i just kept playing it because it was fun and i had nothing better do to



oh wow



the perks of me being younger is i can still see people randomly playing give up robot in class



and be like "hey im pretty good at that"



and i can flex



Niiice



yeah, thats right, i have the world record in give up robot
now hand over your girlfriend



and lunch money

This one time we put project 64 on a flash drive and played mario kart all week... I miss that class man



lol yeah



one of my friends brought a flash drive with mupen on it and played mario 64 120 star



Cool, I speedrun that too



Well not 120 star yet, but 70 star



what other games you guys run?



i want to speedrun 120 star but it's a lot of investment



i speedrun celeste, a hat in time and dishonored



but i havent uploaded runs for any yet cause im not very good



i professionally speedrun shitty flash games



nice



i pretty much exclusively speedrun platformers



Yeah platformers are top tier speed games. You should learn 70 star first, it's a great category



Also, I want to learn celeste too, but those tricks you do with the spikes are like pixel perfect



It would take some time to learn that



i think celeste is legitimately one of the best speedgames ever



also fun fact the person that made celeste also made give up robot



Really? I didn't know that



yeah



i found out because i wanted to email them and ask for a copy of the give up robot source code



and then i realized they were like actually successful so that probably wouldn't work



Eh, you could probably still get a hold of them. Developers usually pay attention to the online world



yeah



honestly it would probably work but



we have the decompilation method of editing the swf so



True



I think I'm gonna start learning to run Yo Noid! 2



That game was beautiful to control



i hear the celeste devs are pretty active in their sr community so you could probably get a hold of them



is yo noid 2 the really old one or the fangame about dominoes and hatsune miku



yeah they are



Lol yeah, the latter. It's a really fun 3D platformer



The original Yo Noid for the NES was ass



lol yeah



running old nes games is probably hell



especially since they're so hyper optimized now



I ran the original Super Mario in high school, back when the record was obtainable, but now a days good luck. Kosmic is the human TAS



found a faster and way more consistent setup (at least for me) for 22

You're a genious



its way easier



genius* fug



I'm gonna try this out today, good find!

nice dude



o but do u not do the grapple on the spinner at the end



i dont think thats much faster but i guess i could



oh that is faster



Good thing it's easier because it's defenetly faster as well, by a good bunch



Not the spinner thing, the spinner after that is almost impossible



hm



for the spinner u kinda j wanna grapple right before u land



the spinner thing wasnt very hard



if u grapple too early u will die



then u just hold down right



yea



with that method i died on 20-30 and still beat WR at level 30 by 2.5 seconds



so there is a lot of room for improvement



Time for a free gold split



that wouldve been a gold split if i didnt just forget what i was doing and walk off the edge on 26

Hey guys, what is the legality of reset macros here? I just programmed one that basically resets Give Up Robot in under a second at the press of a button (simply telling my computer to press the buttons necessary to reset the game, but at millisecond speeds). The macro stops before the timer, obviously, so no advantage is given for in-game time. I just wanted to get the blessing of the group here before using it... And if you're all okay with it, I'd be happy to show you how to set it up too



if it stops before the timer then i see no legality issues, but i would love to hear others' opinions also



For an idea of just how fast it is, here's a clip of a reset for a typical Level 1 efficiency failure

oh thats delicious



using macros is kind of sketchy with regards to speedruns but considering it's not actually part of the gameplay



it's basically like just pressing reset on an emulator instead of having to unplug your console or something



Exactly. When I first found the macro, I actually looked into it's capabilities for a possible TAS run. But the framerate of the game, I'm guessing, is variable to the framerate of the computer (which dictates the macro), so it would break down after a few seconds into a run. I don't think this program could be used for cheating even if you wanted it to



yeah thats fine i would imagine



the closest u could get would be like macros for individual levels



but thats why i use the keyboard overlay thing



proof that i aint a cheat



I think even a macro started on every individual level would fail more than an RTA. Remember that each frame rendered that's different than your recorded frame is additive. Once you have about 3 frames difference, your whole programmed path is bunk. But I'm glad you guys are interested in looking into it, the last thing I want to do is bring a viable way of cheating to the community. The program I use is JitBit Macro Recorder if you want to look further into it



Also sorry if any of this is grammatically fucked. My favorite passtime, besides speedrunning, is drinking



On my past record I used a reset macro like that and that got accepted, so I think it would be more than fine



lost two runs to 20 in a row tired of the life i live



at least you didnt die twice on 48 on a sub 4 pace run



thats true



feelsbadman



but 20 is the hardest level ya know



48 has taken everything from me



yeah 20 skip is just 50 skip 2



I can never get good efficiency on 20, the rope physics are confusing



:zfeelsautistic:

gg



gonna knock arcanod out of top 5 mark my damn words



dab



6th place pogchampion



only 4:1x on the leaderboard lmao



congrats man



your splits up to 41-50 are sub 4 pace. Once you learn 50 skip, beating arcanods record is free



oh def



my 41-50 best sucks anyway cus i only ever get to it when 1-40 is good



which is once every five years



samesame



I feel that. Getting to 40 in the green always gives me that hot tingly feeling



Can't fukkin taek it



and then you choke on 43



lol yeah



46*



or 42 even worse



also 46



running off the edge on 43 is a lot easier than you think



lmfao



used to run off edge on 43



i would grind for a good 41-50 time but i cant be asked to play through the whole game and fuck up my average splits just to get to the split with 43 46 and 48



now i just die trying to do the skip



i dont even bother with the skip



40-50 is hard enough as it is



o yea i don't do 46 though



i do a way safer ver of the skip



optimal 43 strats are wild



whoever designed the 43 route is a madman



probably arcanod lmao



Nah he does it some weird fucked up way



oh the route i do was built off his lol



idk what the standard one is then



I practiced with watching merpells and cyclowns I think



i dont even know what the route is its just muscle memory at this point



im pretty sure its like the fastest way to do it but i guess i never experimented that much



I don't think there really are standards with this game lol. Until we get a working level selector, timing efficiency is difficult to measure



thats true



when it comes to levels like 43 or 18 its just like



do whatever feels fastest because we dont really know yet



i guess you could count frames but



i counted frames for some bullshit strat in 13 and it was like two frames faster on average



Just watched the new pb doggo. You played fucking solid besides like 34 and 41. I'm gonna have to try out that 13 strat



yea thank ya



my pbs always have deaths at random ass levels lmao



but its to be expected



how are you splitting without freezing the game btw?



I tilt like that too



Also yeah, how do you do that?



ah wait its on blipz



nvm



yea



ahh ok



the very subdued 'fuck' when you died on 46



also just realized the "god awful audio" i mentioned in the submission was just my headphones acting up



Didn't even notice you had your mic on lol



ill delete that if you want



yea the 46 death fucked me up after doing everything else so well lol



so you dont have to resubmit



ye just change it to "arcanod in reach" lmao



obs had my mic at half volume for some reason so my mic was completely illegible over the game audio



you have no idea how refreshing it is to have a run submitted in the proper format holy crap



except the death at 7 and the end where the times revealed



Whats the proper format?



i just mean like filling out igt and not real time



honestly a 4:18 with 7 deaths and no 50 skip is pretty nuts



ah gotcha



yea thats a really solid time considering



5/7 deaths took up like less than a second



but yeah ty



would be sub 4 or almost sub 4 without the deaths on 41/46 and 50 skip



yeah ^



def



i mean your 1-40 was only a second behind his



with a few deaths also



yeah 22 and 24 are wild now



so beating him there isnt too hard



and a second ahead of mine lel



i wonder if arcanod even knows there are new records



or cares honestly



his last yt video was 4 years ago



probably has the game in the back of his mind by now



hes posted comments on his 4:06 video like 2 years ago



oh shit right



in total there have been 8 runs submitted faster than arcanod's



2 each by me, rtd, merpell, and towny



thats crazy



towny beat arcanod twice?



damn



7 years old only been beaten 8 times



and the first one was less than two years ago wasnt it



i guess ive technically beaten it twice more but not submitted



yeah



first was just over 2 years ago



crazy



time flies



truly



yea i remember seeing merpell over arcanod and popping the hell off



i had like



a 5:30 at that point



lmao



lol



appreciate it



i remember seeing that run and getting pissed because i wanted to be the one to beat arcanod



i think i had like a 4:30



LMAO



lol



Beating arcanods record was a moment for me. Like I feel like I've made it, I can start doing blow and banging hookers now



finally you can get that lucrative GUR money



lmao



we gotta bring GUR to GDQ



**fails 1 skip**



Ive actually never been to a gdq, or any kind of speedrunning con



ive thought about that before



dibs out



i wanna go to gdq



I was gonna go this year but I have a wedding in Canada when it's happening



imagine not already living in canada lmao



imagine being the only leaf on the leaderboard



man I hope they let me through the border



Idk how long this lockdowns gonna be



daveed is also a leaf



hes 27th



but point stands



theres 4



oh shit so is superdeath



oh i didnt see double0mat



my god they're everywhere



as many canadians on the leaderboard as americans in top6 kekw



Know any good places in montreal I should check out while I'm there?



man ive never even been to montreal



how are there two greeks in a row in top 10 jesus



ahhh



thats quebec



more canadians



bruh



oh im stupid



aahahaahaaha



theres like 9 including the quebecois guys i believe



favorite ween album



theres more quebecois than other canadians



lol



😠



lol yeah just skimmed through and counted 5



whats the rarest flag



including another two in a row



chile?



catalonia



uh theres a turkish guy



turkey



oh there is a catalonia



in bottom 3



is this the word record guy



the swedish guy also



the turkish guy is the word record guy



hahah I've seen that thumbnail



omg i forgot about that



catalonias definitlely the rarest one



theres only one brazilian on the leaderboard wow



i would say that turkish is rarer since hes lower but if hes the word record guy then hes basically first place



jajaja



putos



man the welsh flag is so cool



the one with the dragon? ye

iirc the bahrain flag has a better dragon though



nope



some country that starts with b



bhutan is what you're thinking of



that



yeah



i like bhutans flag



hes got fuckin dragonballs



LMAO



oh shit he does



practicing 50 skip



the only way i do this first try with the nerves of it being the end of the run is if alternate universes collide



Just keep practicing bro, I promise it gets easier



But yeah definitely don't count on it working first try every time



i can see myself getting it like a third of the time if i practice this for way too long



i feel like i've reached a limit for 50



i get it probably 1 in 3 attempts



I get it like 1/10 times



no matter how much i practice my consistency doesn't improve



maybe 1 in 4



its super hard



the grapple from the second last to last corridor literally just feels like luck



its like
the wird physics of the grapple combined with the precision of the very last part



yeah



I can get through the first set of pillars 90% of the time, but the last three fuck me always



YES it's the second to last one that always fucks me



for some reason i decided to make it harder for myself



i do the long swing on the first pillar now



and it's kinda annoying



jesus



FUUUUUUUUU

Am I the only one that struggles with that level?



its just 41 but easier as far as i see it



shit sucks though



you're right, but I seem to get 41 almost every time... Maybe it's all mental

Give up, Robot TAS level 22
So I tried my best to make a TAS for level 22. This is my first TAS ever.
I will try to make more TAS on different levels later on so stay tuned ;)

I use a program called MacroRecorder.
Download here: https://www.macrorecorder.com
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eHttPVbrI0o/maxresdefault.jpg



tried my best



interesting



thanks ^^



it looks like it would be difficult to tas other screens with that method



that require grapple



yeah exactly



but I'll try out some more experimenting later on, I'm in online class right not ahahah



I've made it during the lecture



the only limit is the imagination i guess

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/710399152097460244/SPOILER_imagination.avi



the only problem with this is that you have to time it



on normal emulator TAS you do frame by frame



ok I've come to the conclusion that this software is absolute dog shit



it's inconsistent at doesn't really work when it comes to precision, which is the key element to a TAS



unfortunate



very



just had my first sub 4.50 in the first level

i wonder if we could make a segmented run of GUR



with everyone doing some levels as fast as possible



we would need to manually time it but



probably wouldn't be too hard



and it'd be fun



we could say for an example, who does 1-10 the fastest



we have 1 week to each set a time



next week 10.20



10-20*



and so on



im thinking each individual level as a segment
have ppl sign up to do each level



and after a week or two submit s video of their fastest time



that would be a pain in the ass to do without teleport though



so maybe your method



yeah mine is more like a friendly competition but i like your idea for making the theoretical best together



we can get 6 or 7 people to do it probably



that's 8ish levels each



which seems doable



im in that's for sure



@Doggo @Towny @rtdrtd67 @SensualPudding @merpell



thoughts



i mean i just dont want 50 because I can't do that sick strat



ill probably take 50 unless someone else rly wants to do it



ill see if i can't get a teleport script working in the next couple days to make it easier



That would be cool

ss for level sign-up



if y'all wanna do it



oh that sounds sick



should i be using the same site that everyone else is using for consistent footage lol



I use that flash debug stuff



I'm down. Lemme replay it tonight, and find some levels I think I'm exceptional at



But I can tell you now, it won't be 47



lmao



btw guys I've started streaming this game for fun. I dont really have a schedule I just do it when I feel like it. My twitch is hetheis123, if you're interested



oh good to know



it's up and running again



9 GB of recording straight in the bin ahahaha



lmao



I already have a couple perfect ones on my guide video, at least 49 is salvageable so you don't have to waste time on that. Seems like a good idea, think that the times on each level should be included though



you can just put your name next to a couple levels you got perfect and i can just edit it in



yup, does everyone make sure to say their current best ties on their levels so the others can know if they have a better by mistake?



im adding some stuff to the ss



so you can put down your time and a link to a video



of the level



Yeez, a 4.45 is crazy fast on level 1 though. would be nice to see  vid of that



yeal, Illlook through my stuff



unfortunately i didn't record 😭



idk how you would time the start of 1 properly with music off



i guess music off doesnt really matter for level 1 though



you just have to send it



I often just start while i cant see shit



ill time it the best i can



yeah i always time it with a part of the song



personally i never play 1 with music



cyclowns, do you have like a template for how we have to record?



like how big should the picture be



uhhhhh



havent thought about that much



i dont think resolution matters as long as the game is in full view



i can edit it to be more seamless



just make the final ver 144p so the resolution differences arent noticeable



free



easy



i think i would prefer if people recorded with the offline flash player



bc thats easier to edit



and at either 720p or 1080p



if every one uses a debugger we can like make it as big as possible in OBS and centre the video



yea thats what i do



yeah i was gonna ask if i shouldnt be using blipz for this lol



it doesnt really matter but you're probably gonna wanna use the offline flash player anyway



so you can use the IL timer swf



yeah fair



idk how everyone else records but i just use OBS capturing the flash player, splits, and keymap



at 1080p and 60fps



fps doesnt really matter because ill probably have to make it 30fps anyway



yeah i use obs with a screen display cropped to only show the game



i do 1080 60 aswell



and window display for livesplit



id assume obs records at 1080 60 by default i dont think ive ever fucked with that



i think its 30 by default



I think when it comes to the auto scroll levels we should do some swag strats



howso



if the person who gets 39 doesnt spam the everloving fuck out of a/z their run doesnt count



i would love swag strats but idk how you do swag on 45



well



i think i know how



you can do the hyperspeed grapple in the start



yhea



so just go for impractical bs on autoscroll



i like that idea lol



yeah make it fun to watch



if this goes well im hoping to promote it in other spaces



like on r/speedrun or smth



segmented run of a dumb little flash game made by the creator of celeste



probably fun to watch if you've never played



yeah and itd get new people into speedrunning it so i can lose my top 10



It'd also be cool if this guy Matt saw it



yeah lol



i have some good ideas for editing



matt has twitter dms open so that works lol



Everyone have thr level timer swf right?



i dont



Ye, would be fun to finally get up a bit in the speedruning community, it's a good speedruning game for beginners



I think it is in speedrun. Com for downloading



yeah i was told that



Nice, easier to know which is faster that way



yeah its under resources cool



@cyclowns ill do any levels you might need



except for 36



cuz i hate that level



what do you have against 36



im too slow



smhing myself rn



is 36 the level with the rly precise grapple strat



yes



with the big long block that you gotta go under



o ye



i remember practicing that for an hour and getting it like three times



is that the one that the wr improvements guy talked about in his thread but accidentally linked the 35 strat again



lol



yea



the 36 strat is hard asf



i have no idea how to do it consisently



i just get it by accident sometimes



ive never even seen anything resembling a 36 skip ive heard of it though



They way I did it when I tried to do fastest for each level was just have some kind of internal 'lag'. Grab it later then the latest you think is possible

so as you can see



fucking impossible



it doesnt look especially hard but its basically impossible



ive gotten it, like, twice



ever



oh what in gods name



Pinned a message.



pog pin coming in from rtd



i'm just gonna play through game a couple times and record any decent times



feel free to replace because it's v tentative



Does holding down prevent the character from going up, just by the slightest?



Like, in free air



i dont believe so



but i could be wrong



doubt it?



ye i don't think up and down do anything in free air



^



I wouldn't think so either. But then I don't get how that dude recorded going under the thing in 35. I've literally set up a bit and it has been 1 pixel of on both directions for 1000 attempts



Has to be so very pixel perfect if that works



ive done it before



by complete accident



LOL



o also @cyclowns was was there a spreadsheet posted a while back just for segment times not for a run



Wtf, did you hit the wall and run up, or just straight in?



straight in i think



i can post the other spreadsheet i made



its not too useful tho



Okay, thanks



kk is it fine if i j stick some baseline times in the segmented run sheet lol



sure

editing this might be a little difficult because some levels are so short



like 30 or 41



?



what do you mean



getting the timing of the level entrance right and stuff



since its gonna be individual clips



oh ye



i was under the impression that we were doing them on the il swf



and using those times



well we are



but im editing the footage together into a segmented run



oh



misunderstood



nvm



we cant really TAS very well so this is the next best thing



+ its cool for people that dont play the game



Wait, So now it's just free market over there, if anyone have a better time recorded then the time in the box we can just type it?



i think id prefer for ppl to do it themselves



whichever levels you choose



but for boring short ass levels we can just use those if no one wants to do them



the times there are just a baseline



so you know generally what to try and beat



Okay okay



o ye smarter to j use il splits first lol



50 is gonna be a bitch to get fast



yessir



does the practice swf not work for lvl 50?



it doesnt



i dont know why



ill try and fix it soon



Just a question, In the final swf with all the things in one program. Exactly witch classes did you change, I don't really have to energy to go through them all



uhhhhhhh



player



and level



i think



thanks, Because this shitty level is not working so have to rewrite everything every time

well it was fun streaming guys, thanks for watching ❤️



np better luck next time



"you learn more by surrender than winning" -french army since a very long time ago



you streamed gur for an hour?



what a trooper



you betcha I did



yea



a convo abt 45 hyperspeed started so im trying to test shit



i beat my 30 time by .04 on the way to 45 but i wasnt recording pepehands



I think a place you could use the hyperspeed grapple aswell is the final "corridor" on level 39



Oh no, now you have to grind 30 till you get a recording of it



yeah lmao



Where would you launch from on 39 tho?



if i even get it again 1.18 is mad



It is, it's really fing good



but yeah isnt 39 all lava except for the moving block



> Where would you launch from on 39 tho?
@SensualPudding you make sure you are on the very edge of the autoscrolling bar. Then you just grapple to the top of the corridor and WHAM



you could maybe do it on 40 as well



on the last stretch



right there

the diagonal of the last moving block in 45 makes hyperspeed setup weird



i dont think you can get it from the right side of the first block



> right there
@hetheis Ahhhhh, that's real hard tho



> @hetheis Ahhhhh, that's real hard tho
@SensualPudding that's what she said...     I will attempt soon ',:)



got the hyperspeed at the end



> the diagonal of the last moving block in 45 makes hyperspeed setup weird
@Doggo Can't you swing in under the first one and get stuck?



wasnt able to save time

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/711676539024048180/unknown.png



but my end kinda sucked



Ahhh, so it works



cus i didnt expect to get it



oh wait that does save time LOL



.03 but still



I think you could get sub 19.5 with 45 tricks, easily



okay, maybe not easy



if you did hyperspeed at the start and got onto the top of the block



which ive done a few times



that would be very nice



yea



you can get on top of the block but you cant do much from there



maybe with tas precision you could just grapple your way to the top without the blcok



can you not make it past the lava that sticks out



but ive tried to do that and it doesnt see mpossible



sucks



at least the last one works fine, and that's the big save



yeah i played super unoptimally and still saved time over the baseline



i may switch my 41 to 45 lol the baseline 41 is fucking impossible to tie



Yea, I think 41 is perfected. pretty much



but before anything else i gotta grind 30 lmao



Theres a lot of grinding



I'm confused here, shouldn't we have the times in our proof vids?



tarded and forgot to record when i got to 30 but i screenshotted this time at least :brother:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/711694505539272836/asdasdasd.webp



i have a lot of things to do in one run now at least



1.18 30, tie 41, record beating 45 baseline, tie 48



Get it all in one run and you're legally a god



lmao



may as well make me get a 3:34



doggo for prez



1.65 on 41 again



41 has to be redone because my recording have a timer. But technically you don't have to tie 48



48 probably isnt perfected but im not beating it with my skill level and how far it is into the run



At least non of us has 50, that would be a fucking pain



50 will certainly be fun



yeah thats why cyclowns took it up on himself



Feelsorry for you



anyone else would rip their skin off



no guarantee that cyclowns wont either



The biggest question is how many tricks he wants to implement, there's so many you can use

probably still optimizable



and idk where the sound went i didnt mute obs or anything



Is it possible to shoot out on the other side, so go closer to the goal?



nah the diagonal pushes you left faster than you can move right i believe



Okay, still really good tho



A nice time save



def



thats what



four levels with hyperspeed grapple now?



24 43 45 46



I think so yeah, at least big ones



I really fucking hate 43 though, 46 is the easiest



i dont even know what the 43 hyperspeed strat is



i just know it exists



You grab the 3rd block and use the 2nd to pish you down. At least that's how I do it. Maybe it would be possible to do with 1st and 2nd too



46 is aids but its about as hard as i thought 24 was when i first learned about hyperspeed



so maybe i only think 24 is easier because 24 hyperspeed is like mandatory for a good run



For some reason I really don't like 24,can't seem to do it well enough



my consistency with 24 is like 80-90%



but i cant do it without grappling at the end for the life of me



idk how anyone pulls that shit off



I like never do full runs, so I haven't really trained 24 anything.



im pretty satisfied with 4:18 so i havent been doing full runs as much



I just don't have the patience. I'm to much of a perfectionist so I give up if I fail one trick



i tend to accept more mistakes as i get more attached to the run



like if i fuck anything up in 1-10 i reset



but by 31-40 i wont reset unless i die on 38 like five times



After all these single level training I thing consistency will go up tho, after doing a lever 100times we won't fail that again



i think seeing my times for individual levels has given me more insight on how much time stuff that i was overlooking wastes



recorded a 1.18



Yea, most of the time saves isn't tricks but just nice gameplay



Yay, now 30 is pretty much done



yeah



luckily i figured out why obs was tarding on me before i started recording



well i didnt figure out why but i fixed it



What was the problem?



it literally just wasnt picking up any audio from my desktop lol



i closed and opened and it fixed itself :NurseShrug:



Ahhh, nothing complicated at all



yea



updated the sheet



So what would you think the best possible time is for all 50?



tbh theres plenty of levels where i cant even get a tenth of a second in range of the baseline time



so im not super qualified to answer that



I'm not qualified either. 3.30 is Def possible, don't know. 3.25 maybe. 3.20



3:20 probably wont ever be subbed



in theory



Unless a new trick for some levels are found



the sum of your times was what 3:34?



Yes, they were



the sum of yours and rtds should be around 3:31 then id think



Yes, and your 45 so 2.30 is possible



yeah



And 50 is possible to save a whole lot, mine was not that good



3:25 is a good goal



to work towards



i can do 50 really fast



so we'll see



A fast 50 will be nice to see, a lot of time is on the line there



50 and 1 are definitely the two most saveworthy levels



and 1s definitely been saved enough



Yes they are. 1 is so fast now



cant imagine 1 could go any lower than like 4.3



or 4.4



its 4.33 rn so yeah



I think 1 can get a little bit lower, it's really fast but think some things can be perfected



i could maybe see 4.2x



but probably not this year lmao



At least not now when he's busy with other levels



yeah



cyclowns picking 10 makes me think he knows something i dont lmao



10 is just a gamble on time, don't get the logic there



yeah its just jump on the first frame for one frame



then hold right



Sometimes I noticed that if you run back right before you jump of you can reserve a little bit of momentum, may be a bug, don't know



oh thats weird



Yes, you know you run faster on the platform. Sometimes that happened in the air



i was tryig to record 45 skip with sound and i bonked my head on the platform that was going up



:brother:



Wait what do you mean

Oh no



looks like that means i was going slower anyway



Those tricks are so hard to control exactly tho



Just hope to fly the right direction and speed



by the way @Doggo u can get an earlier initial grapple on 45 by jumping and grappling when u reach the 1st green tile on the floor



oh cool



it keeps happening

lol hetheis inspired me earlier



lmao



my computer sux 2 much to stream



We all have some nice times here and I'm impressed with this whole thing. But this fucking rtd, you're getting fucking crazy times, ALL THE TIME. just woke up and no surprise you beat 48 and have the sexiest 46 ever. What are you



LMAOOO



thxthx



45 is so much better now as well, nicely done. This is going better then I had anticipated. My predictions sence before just seem stupid now



also u r sensualpudding right



Don't get you, you're far as fuck. That 1 is crazy



Yup, that's me 🤫



you can get 20 faster if you swing away from the wall



before you try and grapple the ceiling



True. Keep in mind that if you swing out you'll also "fall" less when you swing, maybe could stagnate then. Don't know. But could definitely be a bit faster



it always seems a loot faster to me



like i get more 54 and 55 times on 1-20



Okay, yeah, it probably is a bit faster. If you swing out you'll go higher as well. So you don't have to drag yourself up the wall for so good damn long



But less time to pull up in when I think about it, so that maybe cancels out



Why don't we compete for times instead of reserving them? I get that if you only focus on ~7 levels you'll perfect those. But we're all speedrunners aren't we, everyone wants to get a better time and is driven by that factor. It's easy to get bored if you do the same level 100 times to get it perfect, but if everyone did just so that they could beat each other, isn't it easier to keep motivation?



I could be totally of, if someone gets an amazing time maybe we wouldn't want to do that level anymore and it would stagnate



Agreed, and tbh i cant even beat the baseline time on most of my levels



The baseline times are almost like the best anyways, they're the ones we all go after. So they are like the real times aren't they



If you're unlucky to get a short level in the 40s it's hard to grund it. But if we play throu the levels someone might



The baseline times are really hard to beat, so low already



^ i agree with this



> you can get 20 faster if you swing away from the wall
> before you try and grapple the ceiling



can confirm

also i think for now the choosing levels thing is fine, but when everyones done with their segments i wouldnt be opposed to letting anybody submit times that beat the submitted time



That's a real fast one, the swinging from the roof was fast as well



I'm thinking like rtd was probably proud with his 20, I wouls have been, and wouldve let it stay there. But when you come and beat his record he could maybe want to get back the best time and keep pushing, that's what I would do. I like that everyone have a few levels, so that one don't just get left out. But I think it would benefit to have a bit of friendly competition. Waiting for that competition could be a option



Sidenote: saw that you got a good 48 as well, congratulation



yeah i couldve done it faster my last grapple kinda sucked



but my angle with the shuriken at the start was pretty much perfect



I truely belive that with TAS-like performence one swing could be possible



Maybe slower tho



possibly? if its possible to skip the entire ground in 36 idk what to believe frankly



but yeah my idea is that people splitting their focus into certain levels will get them more optimized than if everyone was competing for all 50, then once everyone's happy with their times people can step in with minor improvements



which theres bound to be plenty of probably



true, If the competition is up rtd will just take them all anyways😫



that too but i didnt want to say it outright lmao



Anyone is free to take mine if you happen to beat them though



I probably need a bit of motivation



tbh i know damn well my 44 could be improved by a ton



but the skip is like the same difficulty as 36



yes, it can defenely be improved, but its hard as fudge



o ye feel free to replace my times if u beat them



@Doggo 20



oh ight



now that im looking at it i think streamable might be fucking with the vid quality



We have them downloaded anyways worst case



yeah



up to cyclowns if he thinks we should use something else



@Doggo your 30 is defenetly beatable, thought it was perfect but got 1.15 and was so far above

just so you know



yeah with how things have been going with 30 i wouldnt be surprised if i just fluked and got a 1.12 off camera



you should always record nowadasys



yeah ive done so much dumb shit off camera



tied 41 after giving up, beat the baseline for 3 twice, got 4.23 on 20



take a scrsht and write tem up as new baselines, so we know it's possible to at least tie it



i only beat 3 by .01



never screenshotted cus muscle memory told me to skip it both times



not much, but still almost sub 2



yeah im not sure if another .03 could be saved



It would be tight, its a hard level to perfect because you can't really go after any clues. Just have to swing what feels right



yeah its one of the hardest levels of 1-10



yeah in that regard, 7 is just annoying. 9 and 1 are tough to tho



7 fucking sucks lmao



yeah, I'm so happy with my time, won't try that again. So much death



9 was the first one i grinded for so it took me longer than it shouldve



but i havent gotten another 2.42 since



It's a really good 9



think 1-10 is pretty much perfect by now, except for 1, the rest is just a couple of milliseconds here and there



definitely



also id be happy with that 7 too, i dont think ive even gotten the baseline for it lmao



Still have to tie them tho, my vids are bad and have a timer



yeah, I've beaten that baseline once



and by 10 mili, so was a nice surprise



yeah a lot of levels feel like they really shouldnt have been more than .1 from perfection



but now we know the fuckin 30 baseline can be beat by more than .15



and tey're early so even if we don't focus on them  someone is bound to do a good one



yeah, probably 1.10 or something



and then as soon as we get like 1.12 im gonna fluke and get 1.09



if the pattern keeps up



a good pattern to always get it lower tho



for sure



just relized that 3:25 will be easy, haven't even started working with 50 yet and only 2 sec off



yeah



1-20 is almost down to 50.xx which is terrifying



then, in 2 years, Arcond will come back and do all this in one run



LMAO



sometimes when you release you do like kind of a jump. you fly up a bit in the air. Does anyone know why or when this happen



if you press down right before you release grapple i think



at least i think that's what you mean



ahhhh, could be it, thanks



fusge, 2.00 on 3... WANT SUB 2



agh j got 2:25.72 lvl 40 but choked it



oops no recording

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/712029041099538493/lvl_3.JPG



oh no, that's a really good one. to bad



at least we know it's possible now



oh btw rtd, you don't have a video of that 18 record do you? I really want to see that one, It's crazy



o yea i got a ton of speed off the grapple on that one somehow



lemme put it up



You can have it as the main time if you want to, nobody has it



it's really impressive



I've also noticed that you don't have the time in your videos



o ye i thought i shouldn't if the clips are eventually going to edited together



but i can include it from now on



yeah, I don't know actully, soesn't really matter to me



Belive they're legitamate, just so that we all see t thatway and no one that just see it one time think it's faked



yup u r right



i would prefer no times



since having the times be shown would be kinda weird



during the segmented run



Oh, thought you needed end screen times to verify



Just to edit that out later isn't it, no background times



oh end screen times are fine



i mean the game timer



Ah, ye, game timers we won't have



btw, while you're here, when are you going to start this? really currius on some of your levels



was planning on seeing if i can stream



today or tomorrow



Ah, that would be fun



make sure to link the stream and I'll have a look if I'm not sleeping



29 and 50 are probably going to be the 2 hardest



for me



29 is not easy



50 wasn't the best so I think you can beat that. your time on your wr is better



But 29 is super hard for me to do that fast



Don't know how it is possible, but I love 29, it's a fun level with a very fun trick



gonna see if i can set up my stream properly



I think 10 is impossible to get a better then rtd, so technichally that would be harder



Okay, good luck, hope it works



10 isnt impossible its just hard



11 is impossible



to get a faster time

11 and 49, I have 2 levels in the bag, Im safe



looks like its working



yup, looks that way



nice



6.28 29



well that was easy



no idea how to get the footage



i can get faster tho



Twitch saves vods right?



i think?



idk if i can get an mp4 out of the vod tho



i might just local record



so i can take it out of there



and stream at the same time if possible



If you have OBS you can do both at once



yea



i need to restart anyway bc i had game timer on lol



3 is gonna be hard to get any faster



kind of a finicky level



yea, no visusal clue, just have to hope for the best



nice



3.47 46



like 0.03 faster than baseline lol



nice



im not gonna bother getting that one much faster



tough?



@rtdrtd67 do u have video of your 10 time



holy shit

oh shit



Poggers



nice



probably should start grinding soon



cant lose my record



after this sm64 70 star tourney, I'm gonna pick this up again too



still hvn't gotten a decent 41-50 time



I want my sub 4 god damn it



i died on 42 and 48 in that run lol



Damn, your run with 2 deaths was only 2 seconds slower than the deathless WR?



cyclowns sweating



theres a lot of time to be saved on my wr



like on 22



and 46



and 25 kek



also i still suck at the 43 skip



yea



hahaha that 25 man



25 and 44 alone cost me like 2-3 secs



deathless run with 22, 29, 43, 45, 46 tricks



would be the dream



sub 3:40 when



but im not super consistent on 29, 43 or 45 yet



havent really tried the 45 one at all



lol are we actually putting that 45 shit in full runs



depends how much time it saves vs how hard it is



if its quicker then why not



i havent tried it so idk lol



still hvn't even implemented 46



somehow i cannot get it down



46 is way easier for me than 43



46 can go rot in hell



Excuse me there's a 45 skip now?



partly



over a super optimal 45 without hyperspeed the hyperspeed saves like .8



i think doggo found it



its just a little hyperspeed grapple at the end towny



galaxy gave me the idea



Oh I thought we had totally gotten rid of the elevator



i wish



no



now that would be a sub 3:40 waiting to happen



not gonna happen until we get robot arms



making 45 less of an autoscroller would be like



an easy 5-10 second save



lol



i think without my deaths my run would've been 3:41



so still not enough

holy grail skips would be 39, 42, 45



42 will likely not happen



39 probably not



I was fucking around with 45, I was actually able to grapple up a few corridors but could never get through all of them



45 who knows



yea



you can grapple up for a little bit but i always got stuck



39 and 42 are completely infeasible



you never know



i mean 42 will almost definitely not happen but



you may be able to skip like one 42 cycle with some super crazy shit in a years time



thats the most i could ever see happening



damn rtd your movement is so clean



envious of that 25



Woah, doggo, that 43 skip was nice, how consistent is that?



also your 30 was the biggest flex ever wtf



the 30 was a fuck up lol



got rly lucky



nah



obviously calculated



wait why did i say doggo, I meant rtd lol



lol i thought you were going back to 45 and mistyped



lolll



i though my 50 was pretty good



wow that 1-40 time is really good



2:26.45



my last swing was slow though cause i didn't wanna die



from what ive heard 43 is like the second hardest strat in that run



those 2 deaths were BAD deaths too



esp 42



thats like a reset worthy death for me



i know i was like wtf



i knew i could prob still pb though



i need to get that 43 strat consistent



i think 43 and 46 save abt same amt of time



over no hyperspeed



43 looks like its a lot faster



43 saves like a second and a half



i think



i think ima grind for the next couple weeks



see if i can implement 29 and 43



r there specific inputs for 46



cuz 43 i also couldn't do until i found a pseudo-setup that works for me



i couldnt get 46 consistent until i realized you could hyperspeed grapple by holding down



instead of up



and thats a lot easier



and only marginally slower



o ye there's that



still rough for me though



for 43 i jump up-right and try to grapple top-left of block, then i hold up and it's j about releasing the grapple at the right time to grapple onto next block



i think sub 3:40 is the next goal



its possible



yea just barely



3:47 
-3sec for 43 & 46
-2sec for 29
-3sec for overall better execution



is 3:39



plus however much 45 saves



oh and -2 to 3 for 22



i'm def not saving any on 29



i didn't do that in my wr



i turn into a snail on 29



so potentially 3:35 to 3:39



that would be the god run



we need more ppl with sub 4 times



at towny



i feel attacked



lol



merpell is honorary sub 4



close enough



no



we pretend we do not see 48



lol

ooo



sub 3:40 is absolutely possible and im not stoppin til i get it



i can shave 8secs off WR just from improvements to 1-30 alone



not even counting 35, 43, 46, 50 etc



Whats your sum of best?



Hm i think 8secs is a little much



1:31 lvl 30 is quite difficult



i got 1:31.95 a bit ago



it was an outlier though



O shit nvm then



What is ur 21-30 gold?



my sob is only like 3:41 but that's only because i don't use live split all the time



idr ill check tomorrow



I don’t even use livesplit bcuz ingame timer



Just record golds on a doc



Livesplit has a good in-game timer mode if you didn't know



i just use it for golds and +/-



Ye idk



J don’t rly wanna manually input



thats fair



i just find it easier cause sometimes idk if i got a gold segment or not



like if I'm on a practice run not recording  and i get a crazy 30-40



either way i could see improvements of 10-12 secs off wr



from rtd or me



Yeah or towny



im gonna start grinding the fuck outta this game



like after the sm tourney



good luck



more competition is more funner



lol you too



do you guys think it's possible to beat the game without jumping



or whats the fewest jumps



because i think 10 requires jumps



interesting concept, would make a cool category



but yeah 10 probably does, maybe a few others



actually, im trying it out now, and im having trouble getting out of the first ditch lol



also level 6



and level 11. We could count these up but there probably is quite a few



Did a first count, I got 15 jumps, although there might be a few of these we could shave off. Some just seem impossible, like 10 and 11. Unless it's possible to grab onto the moving platform from below and swing upward, but I don't think the grapple is capable

pogu



howd you do 32 jumpless but not 23 lol



wait wtf that 36



looks like it might be faster than regular 36



in fact im positive it is



by regular 36 do you mean the skip done regularly



or just the default way of doing it



no just how we usually do it



it looks way easier than the skip too



ye



holy shit



this strat is amazing



thx doggo



@Doggo You're right about 32, my bad. It was like 4 in the morning I was very tired lol



i was more curious as to if you managed to do 32 jumpless but couldnt figure out the strat during 23



or if you just fucked up



lmao



so thats 14 then?



-1 -36 +32



yup



okay fix'd

you can like, grapple a corner like this, and enter swing mode but the texture doesn't load and you can't get out of it by just releasing the grapple, you have to press it again



oh yeah i found that trying to do shit in 7



i dont think it can be used for anything but its funny



Yeah. I'm just hoping we found the secret to ACE or something



but it's not looking very good



lmfao



yeah i doubt that will be useful



you can dance though



i dont think any of the autoscroll levels have a ledge like that unfortunately



this is where we make a category extension where you just splice 45 out of the run



im down



i cant think of any decent category extensions



besides like least jumps



also i just realized 22 35 and 36 all use strats that are just more consistent versions of stuff on davids forum post now

but least jumps would be a fine category extension

Level 50 section 1 trick - Streamable
https://cdn-b-east.streamable.com/image/tq7ihn.jpg?token=WjGTmUQy3mxtvQdK7kAdWA&expires=1590073980



50 can be so fast if only the time is put into it, tried it out for a bit today, pretty sure the second pillar section is possible with one swipe as well, so much harder tho. Didn't get it to work but were close



okay, I'm now 100% certain the scond one works as well, unfortunately i didn't record, but all I did was having a superlong thingie, swinging fast so i didn't think to much, get lucky, and get it a little bit shorter at the last one



the trick on section 1 is imo a little too hard to be practiced for right now



maybe that will be grinded if we have no more good timesaves



but im very interested if the one on section 2 can make it more consistent



because thats where i die 80% of the time on 50



i can get through the first 2 pillars on section 2 decently easily



which makes getting through the 3rd one easier too



It is a bit harder on the first, but I've been grinding it for a bit for the fastest 50. And it's not that hard after a while, get it like 10-20%.the second I think is super hard tho



But yeah, full full runs i don't think any are viable. To risky



Celest is an all flash game right? Just like GUR



Oh, maybe that's a pico 8 game.



Yeah, celeste classic is a pico-8 game, which I think uses LUA



Too bad, thanks



celeste classic is pico8
celeste is monogame



Okay, just thought that tas exist to celest so maybe we could contact them because it's the same creator. But I believe pico 8 has an API that help with that or something so too bad



I have no idea what I've just brought up on this cursed land. I have no idea what this is, why it even happens, if it's useful, or how I would even describe it. Getting hyperspeed-yeeted backwards by pressing "up" doesn't happen every day. Not for me atleast. But it surely is interesting

are u bouncing off the ground?



I think, tbh it just happened, I have no idea what causes it



thats weird



I also found this a while ago, I thought maybe it would be useful for a TAS, but I found it to be too uncontrollable to use for RTA. I think what causes it is when you grapple right next to a wall while holding up, there will be a couple frames where it pushes you back because the minimum length of your grapple is longer than the space between you and the wall, and if you release during the pushback that speed will be preserved



see, THAT'S interesting



that makes sense



hmm maybe this can save a small bit of time at the start of 45



There are probably a few levels you could use it in. If you can master that timing you'd be a legend



God damn if only I could reach the exit...

holy fuck



whoooooooosh



Jeez that's fast



if you grappled the top block as late as possible that might be faster than the current 36 skip



I tried that, but if you're going that fast the grapple will lag behind you, and you dead stop... Maybe if you're quick you could swing back then forward again?



Also it's really hard to grab the top



yeah im speaking in terms of the segmented run



i wouldnt try this in a full game run if my life were on the line



Might be possible



Speaking of segmented runs and Towny, you haven't wrote up for that at all have you?



yea i was gonna ask about that



most of the levels left arent fun to grind but most people are willing to give up their ils if someone else gets a faster time



Yeah, I'm up for some competition to spice up it a bit



yea i stole 20 already lol



Yeah I haven't yet because grinding levels is a pain without a reset level feature on the practice file



I saw that, a crazy fast 20



The competition aspect sounds fun as fuck though



about the segmented stuff, if anyone wants to do any of mine just go for it, I'm even a tenth behind the baseline for 42 -_-



oh alright



ive beaten the baseline for 13 a few times so i might grind for that



all yours 😉



And we're below 3.25 with a lot. 3.20 is possible



yeah



50 can definitely still be lowered by plenty



btw 27 can go down to 1.55



Yeah, I improved it a bit, but a 14 is Def possible



i havent gotten anything under 1.57 on recording yet



Oh it can? I'll take a look at it soon



11-20 is now sub 25 :brother:



some of my files got corrupted so i'm missing recordings on 22, 37, 38, 40, and 42 now



luckily those lvls r not too optimal so they'll prob be beaten anyway



ive beaten 22 and tied 42 off camera



other 3 are pretty optimal though



or im just bad at them



i know my 40 is rly ez to beat cause i think i've beaten it before



i think my 37 was not bad but i remember 38 was not amazing either



shit i beat the 22 time with music and particles



lmao



o i always forget to turn off particles



p sure half of my recordings hv particles lol



particles isnt a huge deal



you guys wanna see something cool?



I'm always up for something cool

I guess you can call this a revolutionized hyperspeed grapple. Or maybe I'm completely wrong and this has been here for some time. So either I've discovered something new and (hopefully) useful, or you've just come here before I have deleted the video. Anyways enjoy ;)
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/By0UwmAqq68/maxresdefault.jpg



I hope it's cool



Looks interesting to do the hyperspeed in the other way, could probably be useful somewhere



Looks interesting to do the hyperspeed in the other way, could probably be useful somewhere



im thinking level 6, 23, 29, 32



but 23 and 32 are like TAS if not assended TAS



I don't see where its possible on 6



And if you do that, just thinking quickly here, wouldn't you always be shot in the opposite way you're faceing
Meaning mostly in a slightly downwards direction. Like 29 perfect but not other



yeah I see what you mean with the downwards direction



let me try the 6 2 sec



Could probably be used on 29 though, maybe 23 and 32 as well, haven't tested anything yet, 29 is the biggest I think tho



Okay



im sure you can do it on 4 aswell



but it just leads to your death



Can't you save 4 in some way, seems like it would be a possible level to use it



no the platform you get yeeted from is below the finishline



but you can do it succesfully on level 3 i'm sure



whether it saves time, that's a whole other question



It's a nice find anyhow and I think it will be useful, thank you



tomorrow I'll cook up a video with every place I can find



Will be highly appreciated



level 20 is total kapow



btw if there are no objection I think we should call this Inverted HSG



as in inverted hyperspeed grapple



I don't object, seems logical enough



Inverted HSG it is



22 aswell



2 places even



it's even possible to do on top of some thing holy ...



whats does HSG stand for? Hyper Speed Grapple?



yeah



guys I've almost spent an hour trying to do one of these inverted HSG



Just to try one?



yeah basically



got it, then realised shit wasn't recording



but a toiletbreak is also included in the timer



Jeez, that's unfortunate.
Don't seem to be viable for full runs like that, but I'm very interested



i have a little snekpek from level 43 😉



shit's too big

You bild up so much speed in so little time. Seems like the buildup is way faster then the normal HSG



Not faster then normal 43 but it's fast af



it's true your speed is incredibly high



the video is done and ready, I just need a quick word with Towny, thne it's all gooood



then*



oh yeah btw i found a skip in level 50

Level 50 skip Inverted HSG Give up, Robot
I was gonna save this for my big video, but screw it
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hAn8_Yoewyo/maxresdefault.jpg



I was gonna save this until my big Inverted HSG video, but here goes



I'm positive you can reach a higher velocity



imagine actually hitting this in a run



that'd be epic



nice discovery @hetheis



Thanks mate, it sure would be cool



Holy shit! That level 50 skip is insane



that saves like five seconds holy hell



It's really fucking impressive
Is it easy to get up there without the moving block thoo, or will it take a sec to go that high on the blocks?

Sub 10 sec lvl 50 is Def possible woth that either way, hard but way easier then before



Dude, I just tried the level 50 skip, got it first try! You may have just changed the game



Im gonna start trying it in runs



And yeah, I got it without taking the block at the beginning



i don't think you have to be that high to begin with



got it 2 for 2, this is happening



wooooah



wtfff



this is like a 4+ sec time save



if done perfectly



im 3/4 on it as of right now, it's totally worth IMO



oh yeah 100%



sub4 here i come kekw



not even like you die if you fuck up



if your reaction times good enough



it loses like two seconds at worst



300ms PB with the new trick

SUBMIT IT UP BABY



if the run wasn't shite out of 40, I coulda got the sub 4



niceee



I wouldn't normally submit a 3ms pb, but I want yall to see the god 50



ofc



So I die in 43, died in 47 (who woulda guessed), and had a long death in 48, and still golded by like 3 seconds. This trick is pog



the classic towny 47



It wouldn't be a Towny run without it!



If I ever splice, you could probably just tell from 47



lol



woah that trick is sick



@hetheis how do I pronounce your username so I can scream it while I'm flying across the map?



Run submitted. Here's the video, if @everyone wants to check out the new trick in action. Level 50 starts at 5:09

wait



towny jumps with x



this is an outrage



Well I use an NES controller so technically I'm jumping with A lol



controller wth



But I didn't know you could remap keys



yeah I have a USB connector for an NES controller



honestly



pog



you probably play tetris with it dont you



smh



Lmao



but yeah, you can use JoyToKey to map your controller inputs to X and Z and the arrow keys



BTW



NICE FRIGGIN 11s lv50



HOLY MOLY



wtf



you play with an nes controller



is the 50 trick easy



considering it saves 5 seconds



yes



that doesnt mean its easy



it just means ill go for it now



its easy



nice



that is



its easy if ur not horrible at the game like me



then it takes 50 tries



LMAO towny died on 47 on that run too



that trick doesnt look too bad



sub 3:30 is now theoretically possible for a human



pog



that will be the true god run



16 deaths 4:57 kekw



Side by side comparison

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/714297383265107978/compare.mp4



so yeah it saves like five seconds



a little less



might stream some pb attemps tomorrow



ditto



trying to integrate basically every skip weve found into it



i guess i'll see if thats too much



except my stream will be infinitely worse than yours



because mine will just be death after death



lol



i die a lot too



i just have consistent gameplay on the not-hard levels



bet you dont die on 13



ive died on basically every level in a run before



the most painful is probably 39



RIGHT AT THE END TOO



UGHHHH



lol



the thing is tho



you never die halfway through that level



or at the start



always



yeah



the very end



and its the longest level in the game (?)



actually maybe 2nd to 45



the segmented spreadsheet seems to suggest that 45 is longer by a couple seconds



yup will def grind for wr tmrw



there is a lot of room for mistakes now with all the new tricks



yeah



but also potential for a wr pretty fast



yep



if you get just 2 or 3 of the tricks



i'll continue like a 1:41 or better 30 at this point



i wouldnt be very happy with a wr run that has deaths/missed tricks but its something



its weird looking at my wr now



because it seems so slow



my avg for 1-20 is like 1s faster than my wr



and it doesnt even have basic tricks



like the 35 thing



ye



even though 35 is not too much but i get what u mean



39 is second to 45



third to 50 depending on how good you are at 50



but with the reverse hsg it should pretty much always be faster than 39



im pretty sure im getting worse at 50



^



i practice it like the most out of any level and i dont feel like i get much more consistent lol



i get it maybe 20% of the time



and thats without hsg



i havent touched base gur for weeks ive just been using the il practice



il selector when



and the il practice doesn't have 50 so



perhaps i stream me trying to figure out how to fix the il practice swf

{Reactions}
👀 


gonna have to grind that when i get back to full runs lol



tomorrow



il selector seems ambitious but id be happy with a retry button on the time screen or something like that



^^^



or this



i can probably hack the submit score button into a retry button



lol



hype



lmao



the swf editor is finicky where you cant really add code except in certain places



so u just have to modify existing stuff



NOT LIKE WE'LL BE DOING ANY SUBMITTING HUH



yeah idk if that button even works anymore



definitely not on offline flash lol



idk what the submit score button even does



A retry level button would make efficiency testing so much faster and easier



yeah i was trying to see how much faster my 36 skip was



Also yeah submit score does nothing lul. I don't think adult swim even hosts the game anymore



basically came down to memorizing the times for each and doing other things in the meantime of getting to 36



(its faster by like half a second at best btw)



well its much more consistent for me



cuz you dont have to worry about timing the jumps when jumping to the end



im ass at the 36 skip



idk why



36 and 48



are my worst levels



cant remember the last time i fucked up 36 intended route



It gets easier when you identify where to grapple the wall



i grapple in between the cyan and red



i get that part just fine



or somewhere around there



i just cant do the end jump



idk grapple physics are wacky



They really are



im still fuckin trash at 38



moral of the story is fuck this game



38 is my fucking nightmare



yeah just make this another celeste speedrun cord



tf even is 38



im having a brain fart



the slam dunk



ahhh right



lol i love that level



THAT one



i found the slam dunk method in 8th grade history class



honestly its so easy to line up



but i just cant



i used to miss a lot but ih ave it consistent now



my brain just goes all wacko when i get to 38



i thought the slam dunk was how you were supposed to do it my first playthrough



i was like  what the fuck is up with this difficulty spike



I feel you merpell. I end up releasing too early or too late



literally took me a comment from merpell to "not do the 38 skip if you arent consistent at it" to realize that you can just grapple the right wall



imagine grappling the right wall kekw



i never did that



i just yeeted up



and fell in



What does grappling the right wall do?



its faster



a bi



t



stops your momentum



i wonder if you can do like



what you do on 9



but on 38



like slam dunk but then grapple the right wall for momentum to the exit



I SHALL EXPERIMENT



Sounds like some tas shit



isnt the corridor to the exit like two units tall



i dont think so



maybe?



idk i dont have photographic memory



even if its possible to grapple the wall from there gl not hitting the ground



just gimme like an hour to get to 38



the end is a carbon copy in measurments



oh idk where i got that from then lol



maybe it feels smaller cause that levels hard



i just did 22 the normal way



and i got sad



because those days are gone



watching my wr run



where i just do 22 normally



gave me whiplash



cause i was expecting the whole clip through the spinners thing



nope just a chill run of a 22



i dont think ive seen the intended 24 route in months



ok so on 38



i dont think i even remember how to do 24



normally



the ending similar to 9



is essentially impossible



and if it is its not faster



just doesnt work out properly?



rip



iirc the wall is super far to the right



compared to 9



well that whole thing is so far



that you're going faster



than your grapple



if you wanna actually make it



Good, fuck the 9 swing lul



taking 9 for the segment was a mistake



9 is annoying



theres like 2 variations on it



you either get the marginally slower way and look like a dunce



or get the fast way and probably die



or hit the floor. OOMPH



i consider resetting whenever i do slow 9



just cus it looks like shit



at this point i reset if its >28



seeing a 28 time just makes me lose momentum



really? You can get sub 28s semi consistently?



oh yea



woh



My gold is like 28.1



im assuming rtd can too considering his 27.1



yeah ive gotten a 27.9 like onmce



my gold is 28.45 but i was doing stuff like 4 8 and 6 super slow



the key levels are like



1, 4, 7, 8, 9



peanut brain categorized 1 3 7 and 9 as "the ones you optimize"



if u get those fast you'll have a good 27 or 28



and the rest as "just do whatever"



7 very important



7 also i forgot that



i think my avg 1-10 is probably like 27.9



whats your gold?



uhhhhhh



i think 27.48



around there



nice



i have no idea how that one 27.1 happened



never even got close to that



Is it on rtds pb?



rtd is just a god



yea



guess rtd is just rly good at 1-10



i dont think its on his pb is it?



i thought it was



maybe it isnt



i cant remember any other time hes gotten sub 27.5 in his streams



his pb is a 27.97



i think it was just divine intervention



i thought he got it live



sometimes u just bust a fat one



he did



there you go



thats why i said any other



i feel like i obsess over my 1-20 splits too much



I wish rtd used the background timer so I can study his times



like at the end of the day getting a 27.8 as opposed to a 28.3 on 1-10 is like



not that big of a deal



but i want my pb to have pretty splits



yeah, but then you miss PB by half a second and defenestrate yourself



if i didnt reset every time i fucked up 1 skip i probably could've pbd by now



but if you dont get 1 skip why bother



lol thats probably true



i think 80% of my resets are on 1



same. That's why you guys gotta get on that macro shit. Makes it so much easier



^ me but 95%



closer to 90 for me



at least im more consistent at 1 now



and then 5% are 3



like 4.5 or 4.6



if 1 wasnt at the beginning of the game it'd be my most hated level



oh easily



this is the part where we introduce a cat extension where the game is in reverse



honestly that would be fun



That would be better tbh



1 is the new 50



you get to reset for 50 skip



thatd be better :brother:



^



having to do the 40s first



would be nice



and 46 and 43



am i the only person that sucks balls at 48



and 45 if thats ever implemented



no 48 is just ass



i legit have worse consistency on that than 43 or 46



no cyclowns



that's because you get greedy and jump the spinner lel



i have shit consistency on 46 and i dont even do the skip



its just a stupid level



46 skip LUL



43 skip is legitimately rly easy



once you get it down a couple of times



with practice yes



i think i have it more consistent than regular 43



all of my deaths on that level were from running off the edge by accident



>tfw no solidarity on 47



or mistiming the first grapple



i did arcanod strats for 43 cus of that



idk i think the chaos gods are out for you on 47



not much i can say



gur mod that makes 47 just a repeat of 41



cus theyre the exact same level except 47 is cursed or something



man i dont like 41



i never die on it but like



not getting the hole in one is so unsatisfying



i die of greed on 41 a lot



I pussy out and grab the wall



same



dying and getting the hole in one second try feels better than being a wuss



i just grab the wall



it feels better but at what cost



like half a second



precisely



my ape brain cries if i get a 28.3 instead of 27.8 im not gonna give up my half seconds on 41



thats fair



yo towny



sup



how in the FRICK



do you get this 50 hsg



3/4 times



i need the secret



grapple the top of the first block



like tippy top



well yes



but



im still bad



and then u do it



ezpz



4head



6head



idk whenever i got it i would just grapple the top, swing over to the right, hold down and then time my grapple release



thx cyclowns got it first try after you helped me



i am simply that good



also got it by not grabbing the top ez



Idk much about it myself, I guess I just got into a good rhythm



what i love about the 50 hsg



is that when you get it



you barely beat the game



100% of the time



yeah



so satisfying



its the best



It's a cunt hair away, pog as fuck



imn never doing it the normal way again



bc sometimes you fuck that up



and its the worst feeling



like the very end with the block



I've luckily never missed the last block



that must be a miserable feeling



not even missing the last block



getting the last block and then misisng the grapple to the end



That's even worse



especially on pb pace



I think I actually did that once, but earlier on when I had like a 5 minute time



earlier on when you hadnt beaten me yet



oh wait



pls do



I would usually play it safe though, like two hole swings back and forth



Dude the sub 4 is sooooo close



ikr



I want that little bronze trophy god damn it



merpell 35ms away from sub 4



like with my strats and skill 3:45 should be in the bag



nono



700 ms



o



idk why i thought it was 35



smh



cuz u had 4:00.35



oh yea



lmao



lol



mf nicks the wr



i threw what i think wouldve been like a 4:12 cus i missed the last grapple in 50



and i think that was before current 22 skip too



btw towny congrats on being the third person to beat my former wr more times than me



lmao



feelsbadman



We should make little 1st 2nd and 3rd place icons for the leaderboard... Anyone got any ideas for what we could do?



ugh ive tried



disco balls



its hard



mods have access to that right?



yes



or do you just mean thinking of what to put



like its hard to get it formatted correctly



do the icons have to be top 3



and im stupid, cant figure out how to make the background of a pic transparent



cus there happen to be 6 disco balls and i happen to be 6th place



lol



its top 4 i think



just use photoshop. If you guys have any ideas, I'll make the files



ah



that would mean you get 1 disco ball



top lad gets 6



oh i thought itd just be different colored disco balls



but that makes more sense



idk honestly



how are we going to fit 6 disco balls into a 32x32 space?



lolll



we cant



liberally



easily



j thinking abt it rn tmrw is gonna b hype



i physically cannot put a trophy for anyone lower than 4th



just do 1 discoball

i am freshly turned 17



jk i am 8



im 16



goo go ga ga



big pogs



you know what i just realized



we've never talked about hard mode speedruns



cuz they're garbo



i cant beat hardmode casually



I can't even beat hardmore normally



i straight up forgot that category existed



and the wr is insane



the wr is fucking insane



ayyyy lmao



i tried to grind hardmode but i couldnt get it consistent



lol i beat hardmode for the first time like a week ago



lmao



and i just got mad and played normal gur



im sad the hard mode wr holder doesnt run normal



cuz he would be NUTS



have any of you played gur2



the level with the two blocks that move up is where i gave up



i mod it



kekw



nice



i tried gur2



feels weird



o yea the lvl with 2 blocks



i played gur2 casually



and its hardmode



never tride to run it tho



i fucking hate the boss levels



^



i thought gur2 would be more active but the speedrun.com page is pathetic



heey



gur 2 was fun, but I can't imagine speedrunning it. Felt like too much fluff



out of top 3 one had a video



gur1 is a way better speedgame



how can an src page be pathetic if im on it pepega



jk



censor the mod list and its pathetic



i cant se myself running a game thats not a platformer



nah i have a run on it too



all other games it feels weird



like im not gonna speedrun Papas Pizzeria



just speedrun dr mario vitamin toss already



that has to be a thing but i want to know how big of a thing it is

Wait, Hong Kong has a seperate flag on Speedrun.com



time to put cayman islands so i can get those sick speedrun.com tax exemptions



lmfao



malta time baby



lol



well src has a bunch of different flags you can put



better believe christmas island isnt a fuckin country



The Virginia flag has a titty on it, but it's too small to make out on my profile haha



still cant put pride flags



so much for the progressive left

that original pic



fun story



i was in that skribbl game



lee is one of my friends



oh shit fr?



yea



crazy



classic lee



who is lee?



lee is just lee



gay farmer boy



like i said, lee



is he a runner?



na hes just a friend of mine



ah, gotcha



btw let me know if you guys have anything you wanna try on the src page



im all for the disco ball shit etc



idk what you even can edit



The different colored disco balls were a great idea



you can edit a lot



but to be honest, there really aren't too many assets in this game lol



i can rip assets from the swf if we wanna use those

4th place trophy???



YES



ADD IT



towny gets a medal for his 47 misfortunes



make it a 32×32 compression of level 47



please



lolololol



mine will be a small 48



when we do the disco ball thing



100% we will do that for towny



can we make the 1st place a rainbow disco ball



Oooo



I like that



thatd be sick



and then gold silver bronze for 2 3 4



?



That's a cool idea



yea



i cant really think of any other theming



maybe like the lava blocks for 4th or something



instead of bronze



or gold green green-off-pace



kekw



That would motivate me to get out of fourth pretty fast



lmao



lol



but yeah, if you wanna dump the BMPs of the disco balls, I can try to see what I can do in photoshop



jesus fuck i looked up give up robot on yt to get a reference for the disco balls and saw a speedrun of give up



that hard as balls flash game with the giant give up button

if these are 64x64 each then we could make em look pretty good



seven rows for roygbiv



crazy how that works



the images of the grappling robot are called 'ThrowUp' and 'ThrowDown'



amazing names



truly



oh those things are saws



are you a throwup kinda guy or a throwdown kinda guy



ive been calling them shurikens my entire life



i call them spinners



where tf are these heart images used?



Was there a cut romance subplot?



no idea



lol



lmao



my best guess is hardmode endscreen



Wouldn't know LOL



same



i dont recall something like that



ill go through hard mode and discover



is it on the main menu



i don think it is



no



its one of the assets from punk



which is a flash game framework thing



so it just might not be used



oh yea thatd make sense



Good news, these are all 64x64



i still need to pore over grapple code



nice



figure out why when you're holding a grapple, press down and immediately release you get a speed boost



I think speedrun.com lets you natively submit 64x64 right?



and why hsg happens



im not sure about 64x64



definitely 32x32



if you wanna



serve me up a 64x64 image



im happy to try



idk why but i cannot get the level 50 hsg



how do you come out of the 2nd pillar section



with enough height



to get the top of the thing



I just hit up right before release



Kinda works most of the time



wow i remember why i dont run hard mode anymore



WOW



is it hard



doing hardmode every so often keeps me from thinking im the shit all the time



i just stopped grinding hardmode because it was painful



and i probably wasnt gonna get #1 without a lot of grinding



i cannot stress enough how insane the hardmode wr is



even WITH a lot of grinding



that guy is NUTS



its like slightly sus



idk if that guy has any other runs



but idk why you would cheat a run on an alternate category of a dumb flash game



so its probably legit



i mean i imagine he did run new game



cuz he posted 50 skip



thats where i got it from



did he?



yeah



god knows i didnt come up with that shit lol



i thought you could do 50 skip when i was going for wr



i know arcanod talked about 50 skip in his sda post



i just didnt think it was humanly easy



yeah the sheer difficulty of it plus nerves of being the last level



i wouldve written it off as tas strats



it saves SO much time that its basically mandatory



yeah



50 without skips is like what 27 seconds?



or some shit



@merpell Here's a 64x64 if you wanna see if it's possible

can you guys look on the src gur page and see if 4th has a disco ball?



cuz its not showing up for me but i just wanna make sure



it do not



kk



doesnt look like it



I don't see it. Maybe it takes a minute to update



oh shit



worked



and might i add



it looks sick



indeed it did



POG



now we just need the variations



Now I just need to color



But I'm very bad at coloring... I'll try to think of something



i can try and whip something up



i would just hue shift



not showing up for me still



yeah i deleted them



kekw



oh lmao



fucking hue shift why didn't I think of that



rainbow one might be harder to color tho



i have an idea for that one



i might try and make it really quick



You could make multiple layers and fade them into each other



or make multiple layers and  erase everything except one row



i was thinking overlaying a sc



of the give up robot rainbow tiles



or just the asset



also i watched the hardmode wr



inhuman



we can also change this icon

looks fucking sick



im flip flopping between extreme hype and extreme sleepiness



lol



yeah



4:30 am



oof



not worth trying to fix my sleep schedule when im up this late



only 2:30 for me



*"I aim at 29.50 after these first 10 levels. Less than 29 is possible but hardly achievable."* -Arcanod



rtd be like



lol



i remember looking at that and being like



lmao



yeah i havent gotten a 29 in like a year



man his run is so crazy when you look back



because i remember thinking about how amazing his run was



seven years ago



deathless



but his splits are just



not good anymore



did he even fuck up any of the skips



no he just didnt do any of them



it was just a pretty flawless run without any kind of skips



^



just good gameplay how it was meant to be



no 50 skip



no 22, 24



etc etc



No HSG, right?



yeah



yeah none of that



that wasnt even a thing on 24 yet



solid glitchless run



even now the only hsg on the lb is on 24



i think



as of today nope



oh yeah townys run



yeah towny got the hsg on 50



lol



also rtds run



i think has hsg on 43 or 36



oh



yeah



36???



he had it on both i think



46



i mean e46



ah



he means 46



im like



36 HSG?



WHERE?



HOW?



didnt heitheis find 36 hsg



it just didnt work



lol



yeah



mightve been towny



someone did



hetheis did it on 1 first



you like turn around and grapple into the void



so that you grapple the back of the left wall



then hsg off the right wall



only problem is you dont have enough height to clear the exit



if you had enough height to clear the exit you could literally just jump up it normally and skip the level in a casual playthrough



so yea



just found out that zachsk (the og gur speedrunner) got a run rejected for "too many deaths" on sda



lol



yeah sda only accepted like



really good runs



das stupid



based



Does this look good? I'm getting artistically self conscious

i think thats good



however i shall test to see



Okay, and I'm going to make a silver one, because the one you have up is the same texture as the first



i get you



so fancy omg



im working on a rainbow one



i think itll look god



ill leave gsb as 123 until we get the rainbow one



mostly because it doesnt display unless you do them in order for some reason



idk why



cyclowns, use the fourth texture as the base



I used the first 3 for gold silver bronze



no idea which one im using

dammit



mine is more subdued



i like that rainbow ball more



btw both of these are not the 4th texture



f



its fine, it'll be easier for me to switch textures



cool



is it a huge deal



i mean it probably wont be noticeable at all



nope i can tell already sry



i literally just drew over the disco in a different layer then combined them so i can probably just switch the other layer out for texture 4



yeah if you could, it would be nice to have them all different textures



the 1st and 2nd disco balls look the same



unless the silver one isnt supposed to be like that



its not



thats because I haven't submitted the right silver one yet



ah



ok yeah it is more noticeable than i anticipated



right?



yeah

font is subject to change



but the general idea



thats ight



i dont really have any other ideas



its like 3 am



Looks great, you could put the colored disco tiles as a background to that



we could



idk if it would look good on the site though



Where does it display the banner?



top of the page



where it says speedrun.com

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/714404570352189470/unknown.png

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/714408239793700894/unknown.png



If the robot grapple like that, shouldn't the text be those fancy colourful blocks?



i like that idea too^



yeah thatd be a pain to edit but itd probably look cool lol



I could do it with photoshop pretty easy



I'll take a swing at it tomorrow



if you can make it look good then i really want that to be the banner



ok half assing didnt work lmao

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/714412655497969714/unknown.png



Doesn't have to be the same font does it?
Can be a little minecrafty to take away the strange half round block

Maybe it's hard to make it look good



yea it can be a different font



for how little effort i put into this it doesnt look *too* bad though



i think it could definitely work



Yeah, doesn't look horrible
Just a little epileptic
Think it could work



the games just as epileptic anyway



True, it can easily be harsh on the eyes



Hm, idk about this one guys

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/714415246860877914/hmmmm.png



I may have been a bit to in the moment



If the text was a different font maybe it would look better?



yeah i tried to scale it so that it wouldnt cut off at the top or bottom

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/714415606908059678/unknown.png



helped marginally



I think it would. And personally I liked Doggos block colors better, a bit lighter



but it probably needs a different font



Different font is what I'd like at least



I think the main problems the spaces in the E's the S's and the R's



Well, anyway, I'm gonna pass out cause I'm really tired



night guys



Night



ight sleep well

There's plenty of blocky fonts out there



Went back and read what you guys been writing all night when I were asleep.
One think I'd like to say is that timers for level 50 exist in the old timer swf. Still works there for now
There's no restart and when you complete 50 you have to restart the programme. But it exists, and when you restart after completing 50 you can just press continue



the video is done and posted



and for the first time you are gonna hear my CRISP voize do some sick ass naration

hope you enjoy



it's the newest one



The Danish dialect tho, feels almost like home.

Great video, 50 is easily the most useful



I were just thinking while I watched it. Level 25, is it maybe possible to do the trick of the little corner while you swing?

i dont think so



and even if you could it probably wouldnt be faster



maybe a normal HSG but you will just fly into the wall



the grapple is not even long enough to reach to the right wall lol



Ahhh, okay



you can do it on the upper wall



the bottom of the pillar



huh

saying "huh" was not meant to impact the conversation in any way lol



Hm, no, Sweden is the best and we all know it

Except for Norway, we all hate him because he always tries to be the best



is he always the best? \:)



Norway should still be danish territory



At least you still got Greenland 🇬🇱



We should all be one again, take over the world



Kalmar 2.0



Exactly



BTW, is there anything you guys would like to be added to the training programme. No promises but I think I might take a look at it with the current 50 problem



save states?



some kind of level teleporter?



slowdowns?



Level selector I think I can manage, maybe
Save states I think is hard but I'll try

For slowdown you can only use cheat engine if you want to



cheat engine?



Yeah, very complex programme, can do anything really
But on the most basic level you can slow down the prosses of any application



That's probably something we should be aware of for cheating as well



> Yeah, very complex programme, can do anything really
> But on the most basic level you can slow down the prosses of any application
@SensualPudding what swedish sorcery is this ahahaha



> That's probably something we should be aware of for cheating as well
@SensualPudding i think it's too early to start cheating runs tbh



> @SensualPudding what swedish sorcery is this ahahaha
@hetheis we just do piratebay
Don't blame us for this



man of culture



> @SensualPudding i think it's too early to start cheating runs tbh
@hetheis yeah, obviously
But thought that new speedrunners maybe will try and cheat that way, so could be aware of it when people are verifying runs



new rules: every run MUST be done in merpell's home, so he for 100% can be sure it's legit



Exactly 😂



Or we can just see if someone has like 300fps it's probably not legit, the game caps about 30 I think



and if someone dares to object or even give the protocole any form of critique, it's an instant ban FOR LIFE



That's harsh, luckily I'm already on the list, won't submit new runs anymore now



can't we just like say everyone must record their task manager and game at the same time



in a screenrecorder and not window recorder



Could do that. But the game is so small rn so don't think it's necessary now



true



> @hetheis how do I pronounce your username so I can scream it while I'm flying across the map?
@Towny like, imagine "hey diaz" as 1 word, but switch up the d with the same th-sound you say in "THICC"



and btw it's nice to see the skip has been used 😉



It's nice to see some more skips getting discovered. You've done some good work here



Thank you so much



every time you guys quote i just get confused and my small mind cant compute it



you know i just read through all the messages that were sent while I was sleeping, and damn I just got some of that good wholesome happiness Ɛ>

but not by choice



still waiting for arcanod to silently submit a 3:30



man hasnt even been on src in 3 years



dont think thats happening



hes been grinding for 3 years



hes already mastered 11 skip



11 skip KEKW



you thought jumpless was impossible?

i Guess my first born child is yours



loll but thx for strat may hv not gotten wr with tht run without it



i still cant do it consistently really



Prob j not used to it



I think i died on 50 more than 1000 times today



christ



50 with the old skip is already just praying



anything extra just means you need to pray harder



so seems like a fine tradeoff



Yea basically



RTD! LEGEND! POGCHAMP



its gonna go lower for sure



we'll just have to see how low



did he use the new 50 hsg?



yea



noice



any deaths?



six



4



6?



i havent watched all of it but he said 4



Lmao omg its gonna get so low



i thought he said six



thinking back i think it was four



yeah sub 3:40 is imminent



idk where i got that from



yeah past the 4 deaths he fucked up a few skips too



like 29



so 3:40 is gonna happen real soon



is the segmented run also used with the new 50 skip?



im gonna go for attempts on segmented 50



soon



with the hsg



it sgonna be hard as fuck but



yeah im guessing youre gonna have to do the 2-grapple for the first five pillars too



yea



R u j gonna time it manually?



nah ill have to fix the il thing first



or @SensualPudding fixes it



O yea also in my pb the deaths were not minor either



One death was a p long one on 35



And i died on 50 once right before the second section



basically what rtd is saying is



ez 3:3x



yea



so when does the rtd nerf patch come out



you know you should read this some time it's pretty fascinating to see what they've written about some of the levels



http://speeddemosarchive.com/GiveUpRobot.html



i believe this is arcanod in the context of his execution of his 4:06

lol



same as the recap of levels 1-10



and now we can get it in like..



12 secs?



11 i think



i forget



crazy



"sub 29 is hard but achievable"



ie less than 24



seeing arcanods comments is funny



i was gonna comment on his 4:06 like



hey ik u probably dont care but theres new records for this game



Arcanod coming back would actually be hype



"Before the game is loaded, you will see a small advertisement (Armor Games-style); please note that I HAD TO ENDURE IT BEFORE EVERY ATTEMPT!"



imagine not using blipz



> or @SensualPudding fixes it
@cyclowns Yeah, I'm on it, see if i can do something



the blipz version might not have existed



nice



@rtdrtd67 your 43 and 46 are retardedly good. How consistent can you get that HSG?



esspecially 43, that trick is so hard



They r both p consistent, 43 prob like 55-60% and 46 40-45%



They r a lot easier when u cone up w setups



Im very impressed



good job bro



Thank u



Somehow my 24 has become less consistent as i pracced other lvls more



you do 24 super fast



Ye lol i hv a setup for tht one to



And some visual curs



personally I'm mostly impressed with 22, I just can't seem to do it



i can make a vid on the hsg lvls if it’s helpful



~~include 45~~



22 is super consistent



maybe less so when youre using the spinner but without it its at least like 75-80



btw @hetheis you owe rtd your first born child now lul



i have no idea what the setup for 43 is though



i havent gotten it once



i can get 46 but its stupid



I shall make scuffed guide tmrw on setups



Hopefully will be helpful



ight



i think i get 43 around 70% of the time



and 46 like 40%



43 is easy once you get a setup and muscle memory



4:20

ayyy lmao



i just realized



arcanods run was the first run that got 6 disco balls



because my 4:20 was only 5



and the previous record was 4:30



How is that calculated? by time or deaths?



actually idk



i assumed it was time



but maybe its deaths?



I think it's tied to score, which idk how that's calculated



score is just time



okay so the disco balls are probably just time



bro I've had two runs that missed pb my milliseconds tonight



but this new trick is definitely making it easier



I just want the sub 4 dude



Disco balls are deaths...



are they?



disco balls are definitely deaths



my 5:01 was six disco balls and my 4:30 was five



well



I think it's under 5 deaths or something that's 6 balls



under 10



im pretty sure



guys... Is a score of 20,000,000 possible?



the 27.13 got like 3,984,000



so no



you cant get 4 mil exactly



the 27.13? What do you mean



the 1-10



from rtd



oh i see, multiplying by the 5 sections you can calculate it



but maybe they calculate differently? idfk



im pretty sure its coded so that even the best possible time would be barely under 4 mil



for each section



oh, I see what you're saying



yeah I noticed theres a curve where the more time you save, the less and less you gain points



maybe there should be a new category, score%



and once for all see if it's time or deaths that count



> btw @hetheis you owe rtd your first born child now lul
@Towny indeed I do, and I'd happily turn my child over to him

Great and very educational video



Joined the server.



Joined the server.



hey there last time i played the game was about 7 years ago and while bringing up nostalgia with an old friend i remembered i used to play it



and now its time to start running it



niceeee



yes and im rebels friend he was too lazy to join at first



welcome



im just here to support the runs honestly



Welcome to our small community



this is one of the smallest communities ive ever seen for a game



but it looks great



its not bad for a shitty flash game from 2010



and i love the game so much



i think bear party adventure has more people lol



but as long as youre having a good time, who cares



what are you guys's times?



> hey there last time i played the game was about 7 years ago and while bringing up nostalgia with an old friend i remembered i used to play it
@Rebel are you arcanod?



5head?



I mean arcanods time was 7 years ago



huh



is it someone? because if not its not me 😄



yeah he held the record for 5 years but disappeared



woof



I guess you can call him thelegend27 of vintage Give up robot



i was so suprised to see the record was confirmed today



i was shocked cause i havent checked anything about the game in 7 years



so seeing the speedrun.com page and even the record being done today was amazing to see



we've found some major time skips recently



in all fairness the 3:47 shouldve been beaten long ago



I think the creation of this discord has reallyy accelerated the progress



i saw those slingshot trick and and went 😮

welcome



this is a pretty small community but we're decently active



expect more WRs in the next couple weeks



oooo



i think my first goal is sub 5



first try on the game after so long was 7mins then 6 22deaths and it was looking good (for the first 2 plays) sooo i got a good start



and my muscle memory is great from back then



nice



should also mention that we're doing a community segmented run of the game



i think the spreadsheet for it is pinned



kind of half just wanting to see how fast the game can go



and half growing the community bc hopefully people will see it



oooo



i'd love to see this game growing



i honestly think this is a really good speedgame



its short, sweet, good levels, neat tricks



high skill ceiling



my only 2 gripes are the autoscroller levels and the wonky grapple physics sometimes



Hey @Rebel and @evensosan welcome! Always good to see more people playing the game. Let us know if you need any help!



im sure ill be using tips but first of all i should start practicing everything



Good luck!



I’d reccomend practising level 24 skip, since it is like the easiest of the HSG to perform and it gives a basic understanding for the trick, then you can try HSG on other levels when you feel comfortable



alrighty



i successfully made a level retry swf



YOOOO

there is 1 bug



sometimes when you die flash yells at you and then you have to restart manually by hitting R



otherwise its good



im not sure if i can get a level select working within the confines of GUR



cant think of any intuitive way to do it



easier to make than i anticipated, didn't even crash once



huh, idk if you guys can tell cause yall usually turn off sound, but each time you reset the level, the music gets quieter. Obviously not an issue, just strange



thats



weird



but the SFX stays the same volume



@merpell u can put the level retry swf on the speedrun.com page later if you want



idk if it lets you put multiple things



ye ofc it does



This is super weird, now on lvl 10 the platform doesn't stop at the end, instead it just keeps moving back and forth. The music has stopped completely. When I die, it takes like 10 seconds to respawn. This is CREEPY



what the



haunted swf



Also the sceen doesn't shake when I hit the platform



what creepypasta shit is this



i accidentally made a creepypasta game in 10 minutes



lol



you're right wtf the music does get quieter



The continue function is also broken



but i never use that anyway



well let it be known that the level retry swf is



buggy



but itw orks



alright it is added



this is what happens when you fuck with decompiled swfs



random shit just gets broken



actually



as an alternative t oa level select



i might be able to bind a key to advance a level



that would work just as well



idk maybe that will make realistic corpses and ghosts come out of your monitor



i will try it regardless



kek



hallelujah



it works



and really well too



if you do it on level 50 the game crashes



thats kind of expected though



hype

press R to restart level
press G to advance to next level (you can spam it to go a bunch of levels)
IL times are shown after every level



retry button is shown after every level



hold on it may be bugged



ok it is slightly bugged but its bugged in the same way that the previosu one is



sometimes deaths just last a long time



or you need to restart manually with R to get out of a death



j got this 50

did it not work



yea



welp



i still j see scoring time!



time to fix



can it be manually timed?



and if so when does timing start and end lol

uhh



levelretryadvance



btw ill just leave levelretryadvance off of src until some of this gets ironed out lol



looks like its a situational bug



ill try and reproduce it



well i spammed G 49 times all the way until 50



and then i hit R a bunch



tht's basically it lol



could be the same thing thats causing the situational death limbo



think i mighta fixed it



im pretty sure i know what caused it



this one should work

works fine for me btw



although after about fourty lv50 attempts the game stopped auto restarting when i died



yeah it



does that



i dont know why



alright



NOW its broken



cant even get past the main menu



ok works now



lol gotta love flash



not much i can do about it



this is something that ive been wanting to ask for ages



can you download the game without using the browser



yes



yep



https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html



downlaod the 'flash player projector content debugger'



my dreams have now become real



which lets you play swfs offline



you have fullfield my life



and my meaning



thank you



and you can get the game swf off of speedrun.com



its truly that easy



ohhhhh i see



like an idiot i looked it up



thanks a bunch



does it matter if its 32bit or 64?



Yeah, check which your OS is



most likely 64 will be better



if your computer is 32bit only 32bit works



^



but it depends on your os like towny said



same with 64bit



if ur 64bit u can run 32bit



how do you even check that actually



just not the othe rway around



ill show you



uh something with right clicking your desktop screen



if you arent a hermit living in a cave you probably have 64bit



check System Information

64bit



then it doesnt matter



i asked because some stuff dont work for 32 bit on a 64bit system



i have 64bit and 32bit works fine

do i need to extract it instead?



did you dl the flash player thing



oh i did it after



let me reload it



yeah you gotta open it with a(n) swf player lol



just open the flash player thing



and then you can open the swf with it



ofc i do 😄



I DID IT



if you only knew how much this means to me since i have been playing it on browser since it came out



there are versions on the browser that have annoying ass laoding screens and you need to watch it every time



i know right



so having the swf is great



i should probably make this the same res

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/715000946853281812/unknown.png



its weird on the left side of my screen



if you go to view -> show all



then you can fullscreen it pretty much



it doesnt center



oh



yeah it does that



unfortunately



i dont mind playing windoed



windowed*



since using escape doesn't put me back in the menu how else would you do it
?



You gotta restart



wym back in the menu



just open the file again



like back to the main menu



alrighty



to restart i just go file -> select it againj



or you can press Alt, Enter, then 1



yeah



got itg



o yeah another thing have we got an auto splitter for livesplit



nope



i just use igt splits



manual game time



is there a fast way to do level 34? like get hard momentum?



there is but its way too tight to bother



i assume its a little sketch

woof



yeah i dont bother doing that



but its possible



saves like a second



i tried doing it and i can probably do it (only after being desperate for another second



ill try*



it might be needed in the future



for optimizations



yeah but thatll be when someone gets an arcanod tier run with current strats lol



thats the holy grail



how could someone come up with such a cool idea for a game



He made celeste too



the person that made give up robot also went on to create towerfall and celeste



so that type of person lol



do we have anyone from sd.com?



i wouldnt expect less from the guy who would go on to make celeste yeah



wait no



wait what



he made celeste



your kidding me



yeah mattmakesgames



yea



matt thorson



i think they go by maddie now



could be both



my mind just exploded



since i like both games



yea matt is nb



both mean so much to me



wow



i love celeste so much



and this game



2 of the best speedgames ever in my opinion



ive been wanting to buy it for ages



celeste might legitimately be the best speedgame ever



i played it cracked but then stopped since i wanted to buy it



finished the regular story no b sides no nothing



it probably is cyclowns



> celeste might legitimately be the best speedgame ever
+1



super mario odyssey is up there



am i wrong or is give up robot the first game to show time without loads



its probably not the first but the game having IGT is amazing



does the speedrun count for the time in the game or in livesplit/anything else



igt



its accurate, so no need to use anything else



littt



livesplit time should be mirroring the igt



i use manual game time in livesplit



yeah



~~since the scoring screens are part of the game could i get to the 31-40 scoring screen then go to sleep and do 41-50 the next day~~



yuck level 50 got me hard

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/715010017417363466/unknown.png



im using my skills without any new tricks nothing fancy but trying it out



50 is one of the harder levels in a skipless run



with current strats 50s the hardest level by a landslide



I had literally 5 runs on sub 4 pace lose to level 50 last night



jesus



woof



you will get it



yeah, im playing mario this week, fuck this game



lmao



I mean, mario has TTC, but at least it's a 50 minute long run where I can save time in different places



yeah this is the nature of 4 minute speedgames



turns into tas strats pretty quickly



yeah for real



it makes prettier runs



but it also is more painful



because i reset after pretty much any failure



It's better than resetting like 30 minutes into a run though. GUR resets are painless if they're before level 41 imo



unless theyre at the end of 39



thats more painful than anything before 45



Can you imagine OOT 100% runs? Getting RNG'd by collapse and resetting after 4 hours?



arcanod was complaining about some 10 second intro screen



imagine sunshine runners



poor sunshine runners



lol. The sunshine community actually recently started allowing hacked ISOs that will skip the opening cutscene



at least its less noticeable on a long run like sunshine



oh thats nice



werent there like tiny gameplay sections though



im guesing it skips the prison bit



or the court room wahtever



yeah they do some weird system where they just add the length of the cutscene to the run



makes sense



Yeah I guess it's not too weird actually



I like mario's opening. A nice 58 second breather. You can wash your hands, grab a beer, take a deep breath, and ready yourself for more disappointment when you fail bomb clip 12 seconds later



lmao



> yeah this is the nature of 4 minute speedgames
for that i have hollow knight



4hour speedrun for 112%



i haven't played hollow knight but i know a good few people who really like it



its a 15$ game that even if you dont get into it and do 100% you can get to 50 hours played on 1 save



with all dlc's (all free content) its 112%



so the speedrun is get everything in the game



how's that on 40

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/715016079189213285/unknown.png



not bad



about a minute off an optimal 40 so ur not too far from sub 5



also @cyclowns i'm getting lagspikes when i hit moving platforms (for example the 3 in the middle of 50) in the levelretryadvance



may be just me but is this still a problem for anyone else



huh



idk why that would be happening



nopes



the best i'd say is to restart your pc



and if that doesnt work redownload



welp time for me to go to bed but ill be playing the game and im happy i found other people who play it 😄



sleep well



got stuck on the "your total time was" thing on the new swf



did you use the newer one



this one

are u sure its not



most of the times ive got with it seem reasonable



u might have just gotten it fast lol



i j got 9.78 lvl 50



whaaat



yea im not saying its definitely wrong



just saying the time is sus considering all the other buggy shit



also what the hell



my 50 time seemed reasonable



i was getting around 10 secs



then tht one was rly fast

full recording



had some other bugs going on throughout but nothing weird on the winning attempt



that seems reasonable



looks p fast to me



i'll submit for now but i may have to cross reference with pudding's 1.6 later to not be so worried abt it lol



1.53 definitely looks correct, that was extremely fast



Wow, what a pleasure to see a lot of work having been done one the practice file. Won't have the energy to read it all but nice



I saw that @cyclowns posted an update to the swf, well well, I'll continue working on mine as well for a little while because i think it's fun. Here's just a little sneak peak, doesnt work to 100% yet




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/715044890089619477/GURV2.swf



Woah, dude nice



You and cyc need to collab on a practice file



wha it do



press TAB to next level and BACKSPACE to past



oo



and theres a menu level select



yeah, it's really hard working with decompilers but im preay proud



oh shit this is good



yeah i wish we had the actual code



would defenetly simplify it



When you run the code, does a explorer window pup up? or is it just for me?



Yeah when I open the swf an explorer dialog opens up



Ahhh, fuck



It doesn't do anything but looks better ithout



And sometimes when I complete a level, i get one



hyper realistic explorer popups



the give up robot swf creepypasta continues



I thought maybe it saves your time or something



some small bugs here and there, I have no timesaves yet. were thinking to add all your times to a csv and make graphs



also an odd error but it seems you can't buffer right for too long



i noticed that too



yeah holding right when a level starts wont work



Ohhhh, thank for notifying me, I'll take a look



https://streamable.com/08y1r0



ehhhhh, exactly what do you guy's mean



When can't you hold right?



Strange, doesn't seem to work for me



okay what's strange is that I use a controller, and when I use the controller it doesn't work, but the keyboard arrows work fine?? Strange



In the normal SWF, there is no issue with the controller



God damn this little flash game has a lot of little kinks to it



hm, okay I just got it here as well, when I shoot the rope wile holding the right button, then dies, then the right just cancels itself if i die



I guess you just have to release and take your life again



choked a 2:27 1-40 on 46



😭



..not an amazing time but



i could have pbed



damn



f



sucks



uh i fell in level 4 and the swf lagged and gave me a pity win

when the



@SensualPudding gonna be trying to tie your poorly recorded times but keeping you as the runner if thats cool



since im not the first one to get the time lol



i think 5 is beatable but its such a pain in the ass i'll be damned if i grind it



and now for the show youve all been waiting for



can doggo get 35 skip a single time



yeah

> @SensualPudding gonna be trying to tie your poorly recorded times but keeping you as the runner if thats cool
@Doggo Oh, that would be very kind of you, you could take them if you want to tho



13 runs is enough for me if i cant beat anyone elses times lol



Oh wait, did you get 35 skip?



yeah



tbh i assumed your 2.05 was the skip so i was confused as to how i beat it by .1 the first time i got it



Nah, my was the second spinner into the goal, the skip is super hard



no kidding



second spinner into the goal aint easy either though especially as fast as you did it



i cant even get it faster than the strat thats used in current full runs



which is like high 2.3 to low 2.4



yeah, It's easy to hit the wall, but its so much easier then under it



yea



the recording of me trying to get it is two and a half minutes long



could probably improve it a bit tho by not hitting the wall as much



and it wasnt even that fast lol



2.5min, you got it that fast?



had davids vid for reference



I have tried that trick for so long, and you got it in 2.5min, even with reference its impressive af



I just relized that 41-50 can most likely be done in sub 1 min. I wouldn't think that was possible, or atleast very hard, so many long levels



> I saw that @cyclowns posted an update to the swf, well well, I'll continue working on mine as well for a little while because i think it's fun. Here's just a little sneak peak, doesnt work to 100% yet
@SensualPudding what is that 'save as' menu that opens once i complete a level?



btw when I restart a level I can't hold right, the robot is just stopped



btw nice work btw



That's just a small csv thing i were trying out, didn't work with swf though so that will be scrapped. That little bug I'm aware of, I'll attemt to fix it, Probably be done in a couple of days, we'll see



Thanks, a lot of time put into it



aight 😉



btw @merpell do you know what happened to the 2 other mods?



they probably just stopped caring



little did they know...



jumpyluff is still active, just doesn't verify a whole lot of runs. zachsk is completely inactive as far as i can tell



mod me 😏 
or don't because we probably don't neee more than 1 or 2 mods for a smaller game

yo uhh i have no idea how the .swf's work im on mac if that helps



hello and welcome



do you have a swf player



It shouuld not work any differently



you need an swf player from adobe to make it work



i believe they have ones for mac



as long as you have a swf player

yea welcome



arent you the guy who i told to come here like two days ago lol



yea lol i had no idea there was a discord



yeah



wr grinds been going on



and the segmented run has been making the people here more active which means a bunch of skips have been found recently



yeah me and rtd have been grinding for wr
ever since a couple really good skips got discovered



wow i used to grind a lot but i got bored but i seen there was a new wr and it reignited the flame i guess



yeah



cyclowns old wr can be improved by a fuckton just with new skips



mhm



22 29 43 46 50



are the big ones i think



pretty much



and theres small stuff in 35 36 etc



all of those save 1+ secs



22 saves like three



50 saves like five



pretty crazy



29 saves like 2-3 secs



little hard to tell



i can sometimes get 7.5 on 29 with the old strat



the hole in one is like 6.3 right



around there



but usually with 29 i get like 7.9



so it saves a second and a half or so



it feels like more



but yeah 50 and 22 save a lot



43 and 46 dont save a ton but theyre swag and they arent too hard so you gotta



they both save like 1sec



yea



but they are incredibly dope so i will never not go for them



a world where 24 is the only level that uses hyperspeed is a cruel one



i wish that 36 hsg worked



that would be ultimate swag



true



and it would probably be way easier than the actual 36 skip



shit i accidentally found that 29 skip a while back and i saw nobody doing it lol glad its been found



lmao



i was so proud to find that lmao



i havent really discovered that much
i guess like
i found a faster version of 1 than arcanod used
i found the faster 9
faster 22 sort of? where you use the spinner on the left side to go fast
slam dunk on 38
50 skip technically but merpell and others found it independently of me so that doesnt count



i found uh



36 and 45



36 saves less than half a second and 45 isn't used



lol



oh i technically found the like



really fast 36



but i think other people knew about it



oh and the trick we use on 35



oh yea



If I'm not mistaken i talked about grabbing the spinner while falling trough the floor on 22, I've seen people use it tho



i think either you or rtd found that



I also found that 50 invert HSG



yeah thats the big one



ya



but I've found plenty of useless shit, that's just fun to watch



1 hgs



im gonna find 11 skip mark my words



If you do that you'll get my second born child



anyone who does that



hetheis is just gonna give away like 11 kids



will obtain the rights to my child



if you find 11 skip you'll get my first 11 children



I dont even think someone wants 12 children ahahah



directly to your po box



i get a child for every ms i save take it or leave it



Let me kidnap them first tho



what would an 11 skip even look like



hsg on the blocks?



no clue



somehow?



reverse hgs sliding up the block



or something??



that almost certianly isnt a thing



if you cant get below one of them and grab the next it's almost guaranteed i think



to get hyperspeed



can*



i dont think an upward hsg would even give you benefit



yeah



it might slow you down from the time spent stuck on the block



since your air speed is the same as your ground speed



it only helps with 24 43 46 because it goes above obstacles



I think it depends on the angle of your line



If you grab the lower part, you might get more horisontal speed than if you grab the top



i still dont think it could  be faster than running speed



like maybe thats true but in that case grabbing the top would release you at a super slow horizontal speed anyway



It should be the number 1 goal for us



to make it happen



well yeah



then i have to give you 11 children



I'm down



🤝



would ace in 11 that skips to the end of 11-20 count as an 11 skip



or would that be a 12-20 skip



yo wtf is an hsg☠️



hyperspeed grapple



its just our name for like



the fast trick on 24



lemme find a video

Give Up, Robot World Record 
holy fucking shit. if this gets beaten in a day again i'm quitting
room for improvement is probably like 3-5 seconds (mostly cause of 25 and 44) barring any new uses of the glitch on 24 or new strategies in general.

run overview:
- 1-10 was meh, could have been .4-.7 seconds ...
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b572ZNDDGzQ/maxresdefault.jpg



at that timestamp



ohh right



there are ways to do it in a couple more levels now



notably 43, 46 and 50



the one in 50 is different though



sorta



still an hsg its just sideways



yea its the same idea just had a different name cus it was an independent discovery



what does the 50 one look like?



its at the end



with the 5 pillars you grapple on



ill find a video

There's me doing it really fast



i would argue the base 50 skip is more swag



i can never get the trick in 1 swing



i always have to swing back and then go for it



more consistent that way

My controller works!!



i will never understand why you play on a controller but im happy for you

{Reactions}
😆 


yay, fuck took some time to fix, don't know what i did really



now i can move on



controller more familiar



I started playing with a controller so I could lie on my bed and play, and now I'm just so used to it I can't even play with a keyboard now



speedruns mario



Also yeah, my mario background probably helps



yeah but like.. an NES controller?



i think thats what you said you used



woah what if controller is optimal lol how do you even play with controller



i mean any other controller just has unnecessary buttons



the only games i play with a controller are dark souls 3 and sekiro and thats because its basically mandatory



i cant imagine using it for a game like gur1



I actually switch sometimes to a logitech dualshock looking thing



> woah what if controller is optimal lol how do you even play with controller
@DmGotSauce You can use JoyToKey to map the buttons to your controller



is your b button like



the reset macro



Its Select on the NES controller, and Back on the dualshock



idk if i could do that out of fear of fatfingering the reset macro right before 50 hsg



oh so just for going through the time screens



true cyclowns



I binded "enter" to the start button



oh yeah those buttons exist



the more i think about it the NES controller is actually probably pretty good for gur



no unnecessary buttons



and no joystick



except b kek



all you need is dpad grapple enter and something to restart



i think towny uses b to jump



ah



I jump with A and grapple with B



yea



which is sacrilegious but understandable with a controller



jumping with x would make my blood curl



i honestly forgot you could jump with x until merpell pointed out that towny uses it



You guys really jump with UP? That's a sin



This the controller I've been trying to use recently

i am a simple man



z to grapple arrow keys movement



^



any more is a waste



jumping with x is honestly not that weird but its just weird to me because i never use it



and my muscle memory forbids me from ever using it



fair



yeah



after playing celeste a bunch i used to try to jump with c



and took me like ten seconds to remember what the actual controls are



id use x to jump for a bit and id be like "why does this feel so weird" then id remember you can just jump with up



yeah for celeste i use zxc and arrow keys



i used to use joycons for celeste bc i had it on switch lol



default controls gang



If I beat someones time for the segmented run, should I replace their time with mine?



yeah



Cause I beat 17 by 20ms

cool



I'll follow suit and post on streamable



does streamable archive forever?



for a really long time



As long as you have it in your drive it doesn't really matter



Shouldn't we just push in all the rtd times over cyclowns. Would save a bunch of space and those times he got is pretty good



let cyclowns try them lol



by that logic all the times that were just tied shouldve gone to whoever had the baseline time



defeats the point of claiming levels



That's true actully. big sucker for space efficency here but your point's are true



I'm sorry @Towny

the new world record war



It's okay, I just beat your 19 lmao



You wouldn't, I'll take it back 😉



I would say I think I capped off 19, but I also thought 17 would be unbeatable



19s pretty tight tho



Just beat it again lmao



okay NOW 19 is airtight



i thought 30 was airtight



beat it by 80ms



over the course of like a week



I love this competition, we might have a functionally TAS level run soon



also what are baseline times and baseline runners? What does this mean



it means if you submit a run it should be faster than the baseline time



so like cyclowns 50 shouldnt be 10.05



because  we know that thats beatable



Cyclowns BTFO on 26



insane



i know a few times are improvable



1 to 4.30, 4 to 4.32, 20 to 4.23, 27 to 1.55



just got 1.57 on lvl 27



yeah ive gotten 1.57 like four times



didnt submit cus i wanted 1.55 lol



omg just got 1.55



DOGGO ON LIFE ALERT



lmao



30 is improvable but i dont know by how much



because pudding tied it with a weird angle



yeah, I got like a mini inverse HSG of the edge on 30, something like that



How is 30 improvable? I get 1.15s but it's sooo tight



no idea



I tied it and were so high over the ledge, so should be



This is what I'm talking about, some competition is fun, 1.53 on 27

Yeah that's the way im doing it. Holding down right and just launching it



trying to get the grapple on the first frame, and cut the last corner tight as fuck



yeah the fastest time is always the one where you cut the corner closest



and that didnt cut the corner at all



and still tied



so



huh, okay yeah maybe it can be reduced



i think its just because they got the grapple on an earlier frame



borderline luck based lol



but thats how it is with 30



i got 1.22 then randomly got 1.18 while trying to get to other levels



so i grinded for 1.18 and got it



then randomly got 1.15 while trying to get to other levels



beat ur 32 bruv



yeah i knew it could go down to 6.65



6.63 😉



oh shit



whats funny is, looking at it... it doesn't look too fast



because i was flailing in the air a bit



but I think 32 can be improved further



32 cannot under any circumstances look fast



haha true



@Towny is on a streak with these improvements



i mean yea he just got here



im almost positive 44 can be btfo



doggo ur 34 is right as fuck



I got 2.10 twice



34 is perfect i think



but damn is it hard



yeah i think it might be



cut down 37 by .3. This one can still be improved im sure



guys i have a theory about some arbiturary code in this game



like the wrong warp in smb3



I just did something wild in level 1 and it teleported me to level 3



Are you on the practice rom?



Cause that happens



rtd used to have a 4.07 on 37



but he didnt have the recording



so he redid it



Damn, I knew it felt too easy



yeah for some reason i double pressed G while close to the line i came to level 3



i wonder why



shouldve just made it a baseline time :NurseShrug:



Sometimes the practice rom just skips levels. But I guess thats what you get for messing with the code lol



I just still don't get what a baseline time is



on speedrun.com there is a guide



I think it's those times



so it's just the preliminary times, alright



yeah



its just



if you want to submit



tie the time



or beat it



or your run is stupid



Beat 38, this can probably still be improved, but fuck this level im not gonna sit here and mid max this shit



38 is aids



i had to rerecord the times for 5 and 14



that was equally aids



~~also its minmax~~



oh, i've only hear it spoken so i thought it was mid max lol



min max actually makes more sense



omg i actually beat 47



BRUH



The level that fucking haunts every run, and I beat pudding by .1 seconds



1.55 baby, 47 is DONE



jesus bruh



tbf i also airtighted 34 which i died on twice in my pb lol



I dare you to do that strat in a run haha



You'll save a clean second



after losing ten seconds trying it



At least I have 11 and 49 which you won't beat



bet



wait 11 is impossible



and so is 49, probably



fug



lmao



pay up



or find 11 skip



fuck you and your 11, a braindead mongoloid could hold right and jump 3 times lmao



That should be public domain



the first person to get 2.95 on 11 was a small child in mongolia



and his name was sensualpudding



LMAO



if summoningsalt ever comes to us wanting to make a record progression video, we gotta just throw that shit in there



save that for when we get the arcanod tier run with every modern skip



based 41-50

just 1.2 sec to go we can do it



1.11



oh yeah



That's defenetly possible



50 is way too variable for it not to be



yeah, 50 hars, but a perfect 50 would save quite a lot



yeah and 44 sucks



It's impossible, I hate that level. It's like 36



I thnk 45 can be done a little bit faster as well, and 43,46 probably. Most levels aren't optimal



except for 41, fuck that was fast, just watched it...god



i have no clue how i did that



41 and 47 are probably perfect



49 is perfect period



48 is close



42 is perfect



43 and 46 probably have marginal timesaves



45 could have a pretty big one



44 and 50 definitely have big ones



whoevers hovering over my name on 41 is scaring me



my bad lol



lmao np



I'll hang out here next to anonymouse turtle



anonymous party



im tryig to teabag pudding its not working



wait damn i didnt notice this til now

BEAT LEVEL 5 LETS GO SENSUALPUDDING IS TYIN THE NOOSE



HOW



NOOOOOOOO, I'm gonna fuckiing blacklist your IP from the swf I'm making. REEEEEEEEEEEEE



GOOD LUCK, I'M USING A VPN HAHAHA



IM BEHIND 7 PROXIES



FUCK, YOU*RE TAKING ALL MY RECORDSSSSS. IMMA GRIND ALL NIGHT



5 may still be improvable... Spinner physics seem unpredictable



yeah, I don't really know the tactic behind 5



It feels like luck, just sometimes it flings me, other times it's limp



GUYS NO FUCKING WAY



YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT I DID IN LEVEL 6



This might actually change the way I do 6 if I can get it consistent



what?

you little....



nice find though



it's still improvable im sure!



WHAT THE FUCK



It's really hard though



guys at this rate (and I don't mean to alarm anyone) but I see the sub 3 some time in our future



Still almost 17 sec left, everything perfect maybe a couple seconds colser, can see 3.10, but sub 3



we need to find a new trick for that



i think saving 16 seconds from here is a bit ambitious yeah



I meant tricks too, like hethies just found the 50 skip the other day



fair



think 3.12.5 or something is absolute max for now, if even, but well see



only a matter of time before 39 skip kek



tat would be nice



For real though, 45 skip isn't unforseeable



I can HSG up a few corridors



actually 39 for the segment might be improvable with reverse hgs at the end



itd be damn hard though



45 skip would be legendary



It would, it's a long as level. but the last pillar i don't think you can get through



unfortunately yeah, looking at that last corridor it just seems impossible



someone really need to make a TAS of this game



We've tried, but can't find a program that can do it



I tried macro recording it with JitBit, but it very quickly would desync



yesss got 6 down to 2.95



macros won't work, maybe if it's colour checking but no, hourglass i don't think would work either. Have to programme something ourself, at the core it's not to hard, just some things i don't understand. Otherwise we have to go the route of cheate engine, but that's boring



I can't seem to do 6, I'll let you take that one...for now



1-10 sub 16 sec soon



> 1-10 sub 26 sec soon
@SensualPudding



fuck, that wasn't what i meant to do



lol the sub 26 seconds is immanent



FUCK YOUUUUUUUU



hahaha sorry bro



i had to do it to ya



but the sub 26 is SOOOO CLOSE



oh  .01 sec away



.02



level 1 is improvable by at least .03



so sub 26 is possible



we just need a recorded 4.31



WE GOT THE SUB 26



LEVEL 8 BEAT BY .02



YOOOOO



SUB 26, WOOP WOOP



also since yall stayed on each others asses i have the most runs now :swolesire:



brb grinding 20 so i dont lose it



20 is such a skillful level



not as skillful as 11



Seriously, those 3 jumps are IMPOSSIBLE BRO



yeah, I've tried it like a million times but I just can't beat the record



Sisters, brothers, mothers, everyone really that play. I'm glad to anounce that it's finally done, my swf is done.
What can you do?

•    the level selector lets you select exactly wich level you want to play
•    the replay checkbox makes the level replay over and over even if you win
•    you can also press TAB or BACKSPACE to jump to the next or past level, respectivly. So when you check a level for replay you can easily jump to the next and replay that level instead.
•    The game aslo now saves your best time of each level and shows you your best time at the end of each level

if any of you find any bugs or have anything you,d like to see added, just contact me and I'll see what I can do

Download and feel how much easier it is to replay levels now, the highscores will be LEGENDARY



Hey pudding, seriously man you've contributed a lot to the community here, and I really appreciate that



How long did it take you to do this? Didn't you just get here yesterday?



it would appear that i forgot how to break 4.5 on 20



to do the swf, well, like 5 full days. $500 worth of time, I'm really a nerd 😄



nahhh, I've been here for a really long time, GalaxyGamer501, just changed my name so it would be eaisier to know who I were



oh, you're galaxygamer? Okay, this is all starting to make sense now



20 is already pretty good actully, could be a bit optimized though yeah



yup, I'm him, the truth is out



yeah when your discord was still galaxygamer and you were preaching to me about how cyclowns run was wr because of all of the small improvements i was like "arent you bottom 5"



but i didnt want to say it cus i thought itd be rude lmao



Yeah, that was my old acc, my new PB is not that good either though. I'm more interested in the limits of the game and physics



ok i was thinking like



"damn 20 is so stupid to grind how did i get 4.23 on a random run"



and then i get 4.20



:brother:



nice



nearly a 7 minute recording



and i had like another 5 beforehand that i cancelled cus it was getting long



anyway practice swf looks fuckin sick



idk how this is even manageable



to make



hey doggo



I don't know either :D
Thank you though, took some time and I'm really proud of it, hope it pays of



you can get it lower, comeone now, can't have it exactly, sub 2



lol It's probably improvable tbh



I think doggos the one who invented that trick, right?



yup, think so



i think discord is hiding shit from me

what level r yall talking about



No, he just saw me change it on the doc



level 13



ah



damn



and yea i never saw anyone do that before i did



Ayy got 16



by .1



Nice



Then you can replace the baseline time with yours, because then we know its possible



yeah



bruh



Not the real... Only the basetime



That 16 though, nice



Didn't think tht trick were faster, seems like it



Am I retarded I still do not understand what the fuck baseline means



cyclowns didnt



do their 16 run yet



so you cant steal a nonexistent run



cyclowns has to tie or beat the 3.47 now



So basically they don't want someone to just be outruled to even have a chase I guess



yeah



besides if cyclowns doesnt care enough to do the runs rn they arent gonna care enough to start editing rn



so no reason not to wait for them



Then you'd take them all Towny, and then we'd have to call rtd and he'd destroy you



youd keep 11 though

Yay, I'm safe



What do you mean cyclowns didn't have a 16 run, he had 3:48 up on the board



that was the baseline



wasnt it



WHAT IS A BASELINE



the time that the runner whos claimed the level has to tie or beat



okay so I beat cyclowns 3:48



rtds 3.48



Nah, you beat rtd:s baseline



then why is cyclowns name next to the level



because he claimed it



When there's nothing in collum C, just put it in D



so he has to beat the baseline



when does the "baseline time" become the "time"



when the person who claimed the level ties or beats the baseline



When cyclowns surrends it like hetheis did, or when he ties or beats it



justice for hetheis



wait, oh you mean claim as in, on day 1 we all claimed levels



yeah



Exactly



okay, i get it I think...



but what if cyclowns never beats my 3.47



and the baseline times were all from pudding's guide post



if he cant then he'll surrender it



and thatll become the regular time



okay... Okay god damn it I think I finally get it



holy fuck that took a lot of brain power



lmao



yeah thats what happens when youre two weeks late to the party



look maybe it's because I've been up all night drinking rum n cokes, but something just wasn't clicking



yea i dont blame you



its confusing when you werent there for the starting process



and all thats there is a bunch of times to beat and like five weird ones



anyway @SensualPudding abt the practice swf



is the whole "going onward always takes you back to the same level" thing *supposed* to not work until you use tab or backspace



because thats true even if you use the level selector



What do you mean?



if i use the level selector to go to 20



then beat 20 and go onward



it takes me to 21



then if i go back to 20 with backspace beating 20 always takes me back to 20



Ohhhh, that's a bug. If you go forward again, does it continue as usual or the repeat is always on?



if i were to beat 21 instead of going back itd take me to 22



and it would keep doing that until i use tab or backspace



I see what you mean. Well that's a bit unfortunate



yeah not a big deal though



just weird



Thanks for the info, I'll write it up, don't have the energy to solve it now though



I always used the reply so didn't know. Don't know why you wouldn't use it, so don't think it'll affect that many, but I'll take a look



affected me cus i just used the level selector to go to 20 lol



Obviously lol
Appreciate the help



np



Repeat doesn't seem to work for 50 either guys



to be fair 50 is one of two levels you can reasonably practice in the regular game



Yeah, true



o wow lots of messsages



also @Doggo @Towny do u guys not sleep



i went to sleep at 1 pm and woke up at 7 pm



Yeah I'm on a pretty degen schedule



ah i see



summary of the messages is towny is terrorizing the segmented run lol



ye i see on the spreadsheet lmao



need to get my single segment game back up there



Yes please, go and beat all his times. He's been stealing them all



lmao



try to beat 6, I dare you



nah i'm not gonna touch those 1-10 times



too optimal



literally never thought i would say "6 skip" in my life



i guess calling it a skip is disingenuous though



also is there a key to restart level on the gurTrainer?



idts



yeah it's called "The towny slide"



> also is there a key to restart level on the gurTrainer?
@rtdrtd67 nah, there is non yet, I'll add that to my list



o wait u can just tab backspace



lol



i cant do full runs anymore my hands immediately go to the r key after any mistake



I think 1 can be improved by a bit though, and I'm I'm certainly not the man to do it. Way easier to do it now as well



ive gotten 4.30 off camera



never even come close to replicating since



same



tho that was a while ago



1 and 50 are gonna be the money grabbers on the full run later though, those are the cool levels to have



@cyclowns 
Sence you are the only one here, that I know of, that knows a little bit about as3 and programming and such. 
Do you by any chance know where and how the program gets the imput information, I would assume it looks somewhere every frame, do you know where or how?



THAT WORKS??



i just saw townys 31



what the hell



an impressive 31 to say the least, would never guess I could do that, good he found tho, saved .2



Yeah it's pretty unreliable, but good for the segmented run



wym input info



also, does anyone know if cyclowns has video of his 1.95 on level 3?



i have it



just need to upload



not really



Okay, jw cause I tied it lol



youre the one editing lol



input checking is done both in Players update() and Levels update()



input defining is done in Main



> wym input info
@cyclowns you know, information on how it should act. e.i if i press Z or not



3.15...
I'm imressed how much lower this got then when I did it myself in my past project.  Wouldn't have thought this low was possible at least not with so much more left to improve



choked a 2:26 1-40



by dying on 43 4 times in a row



antipog



how's that for pace?

@Towny  what’s next? Formula 1 steering wheel?



I might make a video of me trying to beat give up robot with a steering wheel



sounds fun



you'll get my 13th kid if you do so



noted



For the question yesterday I didn't see



I went from 5:59 to 5:03



That's a good improvement



@Rebel You on the speedrun.com leaderboard?



rebel is in fact not



You should start recording runs bro, you're getting pretty good



Do you guys think it slower to do this?

I'll do that instead so you don't have to download it



i think its slower



thats similar to what arcanod did in his run

Sorry, but I have to be proud of that one, nice



damn thats clean



Don't know if the beggining slowed me down or not but looks nice either way



time to grind 50 to get below 1 min 41-50 then...



I did it unrecorded since I just started bad just wanted to enjoy the game after so long



So now I'll probably start streaming it for god's and recordings



And yeah I'm at a good pace for consistent sub 5's and I haven't played much so maybe now I'll focus on it for a good amount of time and get super good

It's done, sub 1 min finally done, and finally i got that second half trick



gonna celebrate this with a good nigh sleep



thanks again @hetheis for the trick



holy 2nd pillar section



i dread the day that runs require that to get record



holy fucking shit btw



Then it'll take so long just to finnsih a run, it's like impossible



my 50 runs are usually 12 secs



or around there



sacrifice some time for consistencey



yeah,  totaly worth it, and 12 is defenetly not bad at all



is getting the 1st pillar section in 2 swings consistent



ive done it a couple times but i dont usse it in runs



the first of the 2 swings is petty easy actully, the second is a bit harder but if you take it slow you can always just extend out instead of swing out



personally I think the HSG is harder the the first swing, but that's just because I hate HSG, really bad at them

this is how i usually do 1st section



idk if its fast but im very consistent at it so



for consistency it's defenetly worth it, looks pretty fast to me. The way i did it doesn't save to much time



I think @rtdrtd67 usually does the first swing over 2-3, but to me it looks about the same speed as your tactic, maybe sligtly faster but then he looses on the second half



I don't know thoug, I don't grind to much full runs, just like the physics and code



Oh, I'm sorry but can I please steal 50 from you @cyclowns , or you want to try and beat it?



na you can



i dont know if i wanna try and beat that 7 sec



thanks



i knew the current one was rtds 9 sec and i was gonna try and beat that



but that one looks way too hard lol



probably beatable by a few miliseconds still though, if you're a robot



ill finish up my segmented videos in the next couple days



then i think i can start editing it



unless anyone has times they really wanna beat



I certanly don't, and if it get's a lot better we can always just make a new and improved segmented run



gotta love how rtd's 27.13 is "near perfect" and not just perfect



j choked 3x to 50 hsg



first of many to come



pog



i choked one on 50 earlier today



and more than a couple to 46 for some reason



46 is hard



i got a 3.20 43 but didnt record



lol



choked a pb on 50



aaa



aaaand choked another beautiful run on 50

Beat that😏



I'm now convinced my tactic in 1 is faster...



It very well might be

I never thought I'd see a sub 4 level 1



me neither



@everyone look at this shit rn



WHAT



WHAT



WHAT



Now I'll have to grind 1 so much, want to get good at this shit



a 26.xx RTA for 1-10 seems pretty possible now



with that start



possible but hard, it's really hard to do that one. but it is 1 so can always restart



gotta get 7 and 9 perfect too though



the pressure when you are at 9 and have pulled this of



that would be a fuckin circus fire



you better do it with your f-ing steering wheel @Towny



I can't even play with a keyboard lol the steering wheel might have to train that one for a while



lol,good luck



If you spam fast enough you can actully jump inside of blocks, I'm sure some are already aware of this but thought that maybe it could be useful to skip something in a level, couldn't think of anything myself though

Yeah, I defenetly would, Haven't done full runs in I don't know how long. might do some soon just to get up a bit



wtf



sub 4 1



i was gonna jokingly say "sub 4 1 when" yesterday but here we are



sub 4 in level 1



this is some "tell the grandkids" shit right here



> If you spam fast enough you can actully jump inside of blocks, I'm sure some are already aware of this but thought that maybe it could be useful to skip something in a level, couldn't think of anything myself though
@SensualPudding I get the same effect by just holding jump instead of spamming



but it's funny you can spam and still get that extra height



> @SensualPudding I get the same effect by just holding jump instead of spamming
@hetheis oh, maybe you do, didn't test that at all



but I think it has similarities to the general concept of HSG's



the game wants to be at a certain height, but you are held by the ceiling, so when there is no ceiling, you "teleport" the rest



Oh wait so it was like a HSG but without the cable thing or what it's called?
Interesting



but what I think is more interesting, is that you got the same effect by spamming, because when I hold right and spam jump, I just bounce off the ceiling



Yeah, first I thought the game thought I could jump because I had my head in a block. Needs more research



But I think we can define a physics mechanic now



something like: your actual height value will made your ideal height value if there are no obstacles in the way



I think we can even advance it to be: your actual position will in zero to no time be made your ideal position if there are no obstacles in the way



because some HSG's and inverted HSG's are going sideways



I can make a video explaining my theory if you guys are interested



I'd be interested, it's very interesting with stuff like this



*summoning salt vibes intensifies



Get this game on someone like that and we'll gain so many runners



i think i know why hsg happens



when you extend/contract your grapple the game will update the grapple's length, move you in the direction of the grapple, then update the sprite of the grapple to extend to your player



when you're stuck on an object however, the game still updates the grapple's length but when it tries to move you it's blocked by collision



the grapple sprite is still drawn to your player, so it doesn't look any longer, but in the code its much longer than it looks



so when you get unstuck, the grapple can finally move you to the correct length that you should be, and if you release it in that timeframe you get a buncha speed



this is also why when you press down right before releasing a grapple you get extra speed im guessin g



you're releasing it in the timeframe where the grapple is moving you, so you retain that speed



Sounds reasonable. And basic physics explain the immense speed boost if that's the case as well



mhm



i havent looked at the code very much but the theory seems sound



i think there's more to it than that though



it doesn't explain WHY you get stuck but



well not even that



but like



shouldnt your grapple extend a lot more if your theory is correct?



it extends until the max length



Well the grapple have a max, you can't extend more then x length



Exactly



which is why sometimes the 50 hsg fails



and you just cant get to the bottom with extending



ah



brain fart



and its why the 24 hsg never fails, beacause you're contracting and not extending



well never fails as long as you release at the right time



Contrasting have a minimum as well though, if it didn't you would be able to load it up indefinitely, at some point going so fast you would go through all obstacles



yeah



but its less likely to fail



now this makes me wonder how collision checking works



in m64 you can go through walls if you have enough speed because the tip of your velocity vector goes past the wall



idk if thats the case in gur because it probably has better collision checking algos



Probably a basic collection checking. And if you're inside the wall it'll try and push you out. Nothing big.
If we want to clip the hard things is to go fast enough



Don't think it has that good of a collection checking. It's only a flash game after all



it probably does



m64 is like real old



and 3d



but its possible



True, harder to clip in 2d games



Laughs in SMB1



If someone can clip the lava they'll get my 14th child

the you have the file of my 43



many thanks



damn @SensualPudding hv not checked spreadsheet for a while ur times are insane



I've just beat like 3 or 4 times but I tried to do those times really well



thank you though



cannot believe my fucking 48 got beat by over .1 before anyone took my 44



doesnt even look like an optimal 48



44 is impossible, I hate it so much, easily the least perfect time though



yeah i literally cant even beat the baseline time anymore



Think 48 could be faster if i let go earlier



yeah the last grapple was way too long



the last grapple was the difference between my 4.28 and my 4.1



actully doesn't get how that could be that well, guess the beggining is just very clean



yeah the angle off of the saw was crazy



on the note of 44, if anyone beats 44, 35 or 36, please send me the imput file, want to study those 3 leves



yeah, guess I have to do 48 a bit more to get it down another .1 or something



waiting for when that 35 36 44 shit is needed for wr



difficulty spikes gonna be crazy

Jeez, those spikes though



does anybody know when the first HSG was used in a run



just the year or something like that



the first was definitely on 24 but im not sure exactly when



ill search for it



^^



i used it on my 4:00.70 in late 2018 so you could say 2018 with pretty decent certainty



im not sure if it was used in 2017 or not but im leaning towards not



it's budderlord27's run on july 5th, 2018



he was the one who originally posted the guide on 24



riight



thanks guys



ill look when that post was created



unfortunately forum and guide posts dont show up in the audit log so i cant see the exact date



but its mid 2018



the intro is done, tomorrow I have an exam, but after I'll try do finish the video, Wednesday evening it'll hopefully be ready for upload



I still need that 46 clip tho



here's mine, i don't think it's segment wr anymore though

@merpell is it allowed to program one of my keys to do a 'press and release' jump even if I hold said button?



i would prefer if you didnt



but i dont really have any way to enforce that



Alright, just curious😉



Yeah we should keep key binding as a 1:1 functionality. Since press and release is 1:2 (1 press = 2 actions), it would be illegal in any other speedrun



good job on the pb btw!

but after learning some new tricks probably 4:40



it will be going down a lot

you can do it without the blocks if you do it in a certain way



its hard though



but if you like pull up enough on the last bar you can get above it and then jump off of the top of it



I tried to do it a couple of times yeah, I just couldn't seem to get it



that honestly looks easier than intended 46

Downwards HSG Give up, Robot
For some reason I think your downwards speed is capped
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAm9e1rqKys/maxresdefault.jpg



Apparently your downwards speed is capped



I couldn't reach the consistent high speed as you can when going upwards and sideways



and when going upwards you even have gravity working against you



maybe there's only a cap when moving downwards?



Makes sense, they would have had more of a reason to code a cap to downward speed



even when you release from the spinners in 41, you stand still in the air, and then gravity does it's job



so I think you have a capped negative Y velocity



or I would almost say you HAVE a capped negative Y velocity



Yeah they probably added the cap so gravity doesn't just keep increasing



^



pretty good reason



It's a shame we'll never see a downward HSG... So many applications.



Like you could die faster than ever



lolll



Fastest kill%



I Think actually there a downwards HSG could have potential in 34 if you  somehow avoid the lava



That*



Maybe even on level 3 if you had TAS-like movement it’d save a little time



where would u do the hsg on 34 though



On the tunnel entering the level



Grapple the ceiling



is there by any chance a TAS for the game?



no.



not to my knowledge anyway



We still need to find a way to make one



hetheis TAS'd like 1 level



but we dont really have any way to make one



so thats why the segmented run exists



or will exist once i start editing it



hmmmm theres also another question i have in mind



whats your opinion on GUR 2?



its good



It was alright, but I wouldn't speedrun it



i dont like it as much as GUR 1



yea



too much fluff



^



its a worse speedgame



200% agreed



its cool but i feel like at somepoint it will get boring from all of the cute colors and vibrant effect and flashes



too much going on



> or will exist once i start editing it
@cyclowns  Tbh i wouldn’t Call it a TAS myself. Sure I didn’t press a button, but the macro is inconsistent, and i even Think the segmented run has a faster time



But i Think a TAS has to be made through an emulator



you could do slowdown through cheat engine



tho idk about save states



i think the easiest way to tas would be to use slowdown and splice it if necessary



probably not going to control inputs or do save states or anything



im surprised nobodys made a .swf tas player



with save states and frame advance



cus those are really the only things you need to make a decent tas



Save states are like impossible for me to do, but... Exact input is possible. That's why I want everyone to help me with 35 36 and 44 input code. Because I'm really fucking close with a level TAS thingie



I’ll help in anyway I can, I just have NO CLUE how to edit swf files. I Think I have the needed software, but no idea how to read any of the data



Don't need to edit. Just need to try out 25 25 and 44 tricks. Just download my newest swf trainer and press whatever button when finnish. Don't remember which one but it sais in the patch notes



I think I've found a little timesave in level 10



If you jump immediately after landing on the block you should (in theory) trigger the movement instantaniously



I've haven't tried it out myself, I can't right now, just thought about it



i think ive tried that



the issue was that once you jumped the block moved too fast to get back on it



i think



i don't think it makes the block move faster, i kept getting low 3s with both strats



Guess it’s yet another swag strat then



i think on 10 it's best to stay on the platform as long as possible i.e. jump as late as possible



sometimes jumping in the middle actually can help time the final jump

hello guys



ay



i speedrun the game for about 7 months very casually, i hope the best for yall 😄



oh nice



whats your best time



4:47



im very trash



bruh what



im coming back to play it again



thats super good for a casual runner lol



thanks 😄



whats ur time?



4:18



welcome



nice man, when do u started playing?



hello



the first run i submitted was like two years ago



but its always been on and off



grinding for the segmented run we're doing kinda burned me out so i've just been playing baba



sorry, i was talking with my brother



yeah, like me, i sometimes try to get a new pb, but i stopped for months and im coming back



just a question, is my strat in level 20 faster than the normal or i'm just crazy?



my name on the leaderboard is the same as discord



ill run a little before i go to sleep, good luck for yall



by "the normal" do you mean the speedrun strat that skips the moving block entirely?



yeh



because it looks to be like a second and a half slower than that



like, with me doing, it looks very slow



but with a good player idk



if you can time the jump better



yeah the 20 strat can lose a lot of time if you do it suboptimally



yeah



thats why i do it my way



i play very safe



im trying to play less safe these days



yeah thats fair if youre running casually



its not a huge time loss anyway



like, im training the 22 almost pixel exact strat



that you skip a big part of the level



theres a way more consistent way to do that



how?



like, in my pb i do it the normal way



but, in my new runs i dont do it like that anymore



jump over the first two blocks of the row, land on the third/fourth, walk over to the fifth and immediately hold right



youll bonk on the second block and itll align you for the drop

lets see



DAMN BOE



ILL TRAIN THAT!



thanks for the tip man



yeah i have near perfect consistency with 22 cus of this strat



this will help me a lot



without it my consistency was like 20%



hehe



like mine



ill try it, thanks man!



you know my least consistent level?



np



the first one lol



which



oh



yeah



1 is fucking garbage



i really hate that shit



thankfully its at the start



oh yeah



but my consistency is like 10%



mine is like 5 hueheuheudhe



i lose half of time playing just on that level



to train it



ill run a bit



thanks for everything man



> 4:47
@LycroP2 better than me ;')



just train and youll pass me easily hueheuhee



hey guys



im trying to use the sensualpudding training mode



but when it opens with the flash projector just shows a white screen



nevermind



what swf player are you using



oh



ok



i did it



holy shit it was loud



rip my ears



im so used to muting the chrome GUR page



its ok to submit a run using the trainer file? (playing it normally)



it looks a lot smoother



does it show final game time at the end?



let me see



no



it just shows you the time on the level



ri´p



then no



sorry



okok, its totally understandable



ill download the normal swf file so



that could be an ok idea actually



swf that just makes the 1-10 1-20 etc. screens go by instantly



would be kinda sus but probably fine for submitting?



idk



a file with a reset button, or there is one on the flash projector?



wdym reset button



like



with a command like



you press j and it goes back to the front page



towny has a macro that immediately restarts



ºoº



on bowser thats called f5



ehuehueheuheuehe



it shouldnt be f5?

huehueheuheuheehueueuh



oh u edited the message



im a little bit slow dont mind it



oh



yeah youre fine



and another one, a mute button



thats a good one



you press m and boom that damn music is gone



if youre using an swf player you can just use the volume mixer



ok, im dumb



hueheuehueheuheuehueheuheuehuehe



i needc to think more before speaking

oh no the ss intro music LOL



I would lie if I said he wasn’t an inspiration



@LycroP2 Hello newfriend



yeah I use JitBit Macro Recorder for my resets, you'll have to program it yourself



If you have trouble setting one up, I can help you out



So this short GUR hype is sence long dead it seems like, but sence adobes flash player closes down at the end of the year, someone should upload the download file to Speedrun.com so that new players can get it



isn't it already on the website

nope, I mean adobe flash player

maybe, it's not 100% accurate so it can't do the exactness like 35 and 36, but it works



woah that looks really promising, could it  be used to optimize a level like 2



Maybe, it's pretty hard to get it exact tho and I think it jumps over a frame here and there and just take s the same as the past imput



Total optimisation is probably not possible but harder levels can be done faster



ah okay i see what u r sayin



Is it possible to convert an SWF to HTML5? If we can get an html5 build, that could save the game in the long run



everything is possible, but in converting it's no longer the original game, things could change



i hate my pc man



i was 8 seconds ahead of my pb



and then



FROM NOWHERE]



FUCKING PORTAL 2 OPENED UP



AND GUR DINDT STOPPED



AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



hey



at least it opened a good game



well



thats true



but ya hate to see it



yeah, possible pb lost ;-;



lets try again



hey, a quick qustion right here, do you guys think you play worse when listening to music while playing?



I mean I thinks it's trash music, but I don't know if it affects my gameplay



P sure music helps me, i was listening to music during my wr run



i listen to music when i practice but not when i record



bc gotta have that pure gameplay experience



hmmmm interesting responses hehehe



> bc gotta have that pure gameplay experience
@cyclowns thats a good point



i always listen to music or podcasts while playing, in my pb* was listening to a hearthstone video



but ill try some runs without music



lets see if it impacts on the gameplay



thanks for the responses!



I always play with the music. It pumps me up



It can get a little obnoxious when I'm constantly resetting though



But I don't think it distracts me at all



i was 10 seconds ahead of my pb and choked at 48 😦



> But I don't think it distracts me at all
@Towny like, for me i think it takes away my pressure, but takes away my consistency

got to 41-50 and literally died on every level 41 through 44 then reset



and then i fail 1-3 thirty runs in a row



love this game



i keep getting 28.0x



i just want the 27



im cryig



Honestly i wanna come back to this game to grind for 2x at some point



Rn j hv too much stuff going on

same



kinda just had to stop grinding



lol 30.00 exactly

\:O



i will submit to the will of the first person to get 26.xx



😳  hheheuehueehu



If sensualpudding can pull off that sub 4 second level 1 in a run, 26.xx is free



quite possibly the largest "if" i've ever come across



also not dying on 3 under that much pressure isnt free :brother:



this game is becoming very close wow



Joined the server.



welcome \:)



hello



welcome \:D



i speedran this game for fun to pass time at school a couple years ago but never submitted anything, now i want to revisit it and get a good time



well, if you dont count level 1 and 48, you'll have lots of fun kekekekekeke



I truly hate these 2 levels



i will probably grow to hate them then



i also realized recently that the dev of celeste and towerfall made the give up robot games which is cool bc i run celeste and its one of my favorite games



ºOº



i didnt knew that



yeah maddie is a great dev



also you will definitely grow to hate 1



as a warning



48 i dont find much more annoying than the other harder levels



like 38 and 46



everyone hates level 1



so why hate level 1



> like 38 and 46
@Doggo at high level level 46 is very annoying



i see the strat and it looks annoying



is it just bc its annoying to spam reset trying to get a good level 1



because you have to do a perfect timed jump



Yes



if you fuck up in 1



you lose like 4 sec



yeh



thats a hyperbole but still

took way too long to get sub 5 i think i choked on 50 at least 10 times



sick time man



nice



i'll record next time i try to pb and post it hopefully



ah no recording rip



yeah



is the only way to reset to close the window and reopen the game?



i dont see any way to pause or go to menu once youre in a game



i go file -> and then reopen



the swf



otherwise not really



ok



so you have to change settings again but at least you dont have to resize the window



slightly better



thats why i just screen record blipz



also 4:22 as your first sub 5 wtf



Everything clicked that run and I didn’t die on room 50



I need to learn the fast strat where you don’t need the first pixel to carry you through the level bc right now the level takes about 28 seconds



you can do lv50 in less than ten seconds



by skipping the first pixel and doing hyperspeed at the end to skip waiting for the last block to rise



but you gotta do it fast as fuuck for sub 10



it generally takes like 12-13 seconds



Sweet



So is hyper speed the name for the thing you do where you stretch your tether and then release around a corner for a boost



I only use it on level 24 atm



yes



50 is dubbed reverse hyperspeed bcuz u extend grapple instead of contracting



or maybe it's because u go under the block not sure tbh



its a bit of a misnomer lol



you can do the hyperspeed in 46 with extending or contracting right



yeah



level 50 is hard



1 and 50 are forever the hardest levels



> took way too long to get sub 5 i think i choked on 50 at least 10 times
@Klice that picture is imperial circus :3



and to be4 more exact its UTA

but its because you have determination

how much time since i last played osu



pb by like 2 seconds if not choke also lost at least 10 seconds to dumb deaths i will pb today

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/730575139330326578/unknown.png



nice one bro



i tried playing today but I was full tilted so it wasnt the best time ksksk



tilt kills



oh it does



the thing is that ive not played this game seriously for months, so my time has improved, but im not capable of not choking once 👍



at level 40 im like 15-20 seconds ahead of my pb but them i choke \:D



im horrible at this shit 😎 👍



cool thing about such a short game is you can spam reset but i get tired of having to resize the window every time



maybe i should play the online version



just refresh the page



man



i used to play at the online version



but idk, for me the file looks more smooth



try yourself the online



ok



tell me what you think about both versions after \:D



tbh i dont even resize the window



the screen changes are way less smooth



> tbh i dont even resize the window
@merpell oh man, how can you play like that?



i already like online less



i should get used to not resizing so the problem vanishes



its not bad, just small



> the screen changes are way less smooth
@Klice yeah as i thought



> its not bad, just small
@merpell so, for me it looks less accurate



i feel like the online blipz version which i used to always use already has a small window



so the non-resized flash window is just normal



when i played at blipz i used to zoom



120% i think



and chrome saves the sites you zoom so for me was good



but when i switched to file HMMMMMMMMMMMM DELICIOUS



ah i see yes makes sense



> ah i see yes makes sense
@rtdrtd67 the only bad part is the resizing ;-;



and, me being shit at this game obviously



nah dude ur not bad at all



also i use obs and when i resize it messes up my capture



may just not know how to use obs but yea



> nah dude ur not bad at all
@rtdrtd67 thanks man \:D its just that i cant play this without choking 90% of the time u know



> also i use obs and when i resize it messes up my capture
@rtdrtd67 i havent got a pb since i moved to file so i have no idea 😎 👍



i just record my whole screen with obs lol i cant get it to just capture the game



just do window capture



> i just record my whole screen with obs lol i cant get it to just capture the game
@Klice u have to add a scene



game capture



and select the file



its so funny how a flash game from 2010 still have some insterested people



when did you guys discovered GUR?



and when started speedrunning it?



started running early 2018



i remember when i saw merpell get 402 that rly motivated me



cause someone finally beat arcanod



> started running early 2018
@rtdrtd67 a little before me i started  mid 18



> cause someone finally beat arcanod
@rtdrtd67



i started running like late ish 2017 i think
i found the game in like history class in middle school
and i just started playing it in class bc i love platformers and its a really good speedgame



seeing someone beating Arcanod fills you with determination



eventually got good times and i realized there was a speedrun.com page for the game



i think my first time i submitted was like a 4:30



> i started running like late ish 2017 i think
> i found the game in like history class in middle school
> and i just started playing it in class bc i love platformers and its a really good speedgame
@cyclowns just like me lol i discovered it in 2014 i think at computing class



> i think my first time i submitted was like a 4:30
@cyclowns im going to beat it (;-;) some day (;-;)

nobody plays this game
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TEuRMpOlDiI/maxresdefault.jpg



first run was feb 2018



yea



i got into speedrunning it cause me and my friend used to race against each other



yeah thats sorta how it started



i played it a lot in compsci class w/ my friends and we raced and i would always win



^ same



bruhhh



yea exactly for me too



but at a summer camp



> i got into speedrunning it cause me and my friend used to race against each other
@LycroP2 he was a little better than me and that motivated me to improve



holy, everyone here likes competition! hehehe



you're right



we should upload our best times onto a leaderboard to see who's the fastest



oh wait



i care a lil less about competetion than i did



i just wanna see the time go lower



and have a good time



> oh wait
@merpell KEEKEKEKEKEKEK



i would i want to expose to the world that im bad lol



i still need to edit the segmented run



llmao



i forget about that



ive made scenes in obs before but this one doesnt recognize adobe flash as a window or something dumb



obs has always been finnicky for me



i think i played this game first in middle school and thought it was fun then one day in high school i was bored and i remembered the game and tried to run it



then looked up the wr video and copied the strats



yo segmented run is a 3:12 wtf



is it that low now



lol



25.45 1-10



jesus



this lvl 50 by pudding still amazes me



right?



yeah i have no idea how he did that



the lowest ive gotten trying to speedrun it was like 9secs



i think ima start editing the segmented run tn



pudding's ILs r all kinda insane tbh



i have videos for mine i jsut never cut/uploaded them



im not sure how i wanna do timing



i think what im gonna do



is just ignore the whole like time thing the game does after every 10 levels



and just keep a running real time timer



it might be a couple secs off



pudding and towny are madmen



that 6 is ridiculous



holy shit i didnt even see 6



wtf



yea it's ridiculous



so hard to actually get speed from that grapple



this is gonna be fun to watch as a full run



im hoping it can get ppl that havent played the game before to be interested but idk



31s also surprisingly technical for being yknow   31



but yea the goal of this is just to spread it in speedrunning places and get a few new guys right



hopefully yeah



post it on r/speedrun or smth



i think the real-time timer should b fairly accurate



it'll be pretty close



if i edit it well it'll be really close



if its like a second or two off then ill just edit in the real IGT at the end or something



downloading all of these videos is going to be slightly annoying



iirc one of them is on bandicam



so we should probably try to tie it lmao



idr which though



thought it was 36 but i just checked and n



itll already be a little off bc not all of them have music i think



but w/e



i can maybe just edit the music in



lmao



sfx you mean?



that as well



that probably wouldve needed to be edited in anyway



im not sure



i might just mute every clip and edit the music in



most of mine have the death sfx from the last attempt



editing the sfx in myself would be pretty annoying..



but i might actually do it..



wouldnt be too much of a loss if it were just the music



oh ya oops sry abt that



its gotta be an immersive experience



but if youre up to it then itd be nice



p sure none of mine hv sfx



if im lazy ill just mute everything and edit in just music



39 has a fucking cursor



pudding youve doomed us



if the area around the cursor doesnt move i can edit it out easily



..or i wont because it doesnt rly matter



shit thats a big cursor



yeah



LMAO



..ill just leave it in



actually no ill just tie 39 or something



its 39 cant be that hard



also my 44 is still actual ass



not the recording or anything its just slow as fuck



the end strat on 44 is so inconsistent that it would be annoying to do it



i hv never done 44 in two grapples



ive grinded it for like



half an hour?



and that was the only time i got it i think



i have only ever done it once



like a year ago



it barely beat puddings 44 without the skip from the old fastest times forum post



so it might be beatable anyway



not sure if that would be more or less tedious



2 11 42 and 49 are probably like the only times from that forum post still standing



i remember beating the 42



i think pudding brought it down lower after that



it mightve been 10.05 on the forum post



how do you even beat 42



literally like 0.01 sec



hold right earlier lol



yea idk how



i j do it and hope the last decimal is a small number



thats how i do 10



10s ass



i think 30 is still barely beatable but god knows if anyone gives a fuck



literally just frame perfect grapple as soon as youre in control



im gonna edit in little name cards on the screen for whoever did the levels
so if u guys have a preferred profile pic/name that you want used for that u can put it here or dm me



@Towny @SensualPudding as well



oh i was thinking you'd just use screenshots of our speedrun.com profiles or something like that



i was thinking an intro section at the beginning with pfps and name and stuff along with place on leaderboard



and then for the name cards on each level just the name and flag + level time



that works



but if anyone would prefer a name that isn't their speedrun.com name then just lemme know i guess



<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/322782787386081290/730590359733927986/68470397_p4_master1200_2.jpg> works for my pfp then



and if no one else has objections to their src name then i'll keep funny_dog_man for the sake of consistency



funny dog man



r u sure u dont want it as doggo



doggos probably better yeah lmao

this doesnt maen anything right



the SWF is allowed



i used the file version whateber its called



that should maybe get updated



ok



@merpell



change platform to web/flash player or something



yeah i dojt think you can emulate gur for an advantage lmao



web makes the most sense



you cant like type whatever you want in it's just a list of platforms



and most are consoles



oh that sucks



is there any way to like say that the swf player is fine



ill see what i can do



i dont think there's anyway to do it



besides making a note in the rules



which i will do



unlucky



> lets go
@Klice holy man, you're evolving VERY fast ggs congrats



hey guys, good luck on the segmented run \:D , sorry for dont helping, it cuz i'm bad ;-;



ay @Klice how long have you been running? 4:10 is a great time



also @cyclowns you can just use my picture from here



<---------



@cyclowns sorry I've been away for a while, didn't see the request. Can just use SensualPudding and my old profile pic, one sec I'll turn it back and give it to you

I’ve played the game a lot but only started grinding recently @Towny



Just watched the run, good job! If you learn fast 50 you'll get the sub 4 for sure



hey @SensualPudding i dont know much about moddig flash and et, but, is there a way to change the resolution of the game or something like that? so if its possible u put on full screen or big as possible and them we dont need to resize the file on flash player



is it possible to do this?



I think that could be done. Maybe
I'll have to do some testing
Fun idea

I'll try it out for a few days and maybe



oh boy that would be good \:D



thanks for helping the community \:D



No promises tho. I'm not that adequate with this sort of stuff



no problem, the intencion alone is good enough \:)



intention*



Just so you know, a 1080x1920 version of the game wouldn't be acceptable as a rea speedrun attempt. To see more or less changes the game and would make it an unfare game

So would have to be in the practice swf



oh, so isnt possible to do a square file just bigger? sad \:(



I guess, but I think that's up to the swf player in question
I'll take a look

Thought you meant a ful screen like, you know 16:9 screen, so that you'd see more of like level 1 etc



nah, thats cheating basically



16:9 for GUR would be like using 3rd person camera on an FPS

@SensualPudding so there's still hope! \:D



Yeah, that's an perfect parable 😄



Yup, hope there's always, it would probably be easier



> Yeah, that's an perfect parable 😄
@SensualPudding hehehehe



> Yup, hope there's always, it would probably be easier
@SensualPudding #nomoreresizing



os srry, i think the right way would be #resizingnomore



both work grammatically



ºoº but the first one is almost unused



hey, its the level 20 best time 5.00?



or it have been improved?



Nah, its been improved to 420



ɴɪᴄᴇ



~NICE~



proud to be of service



no 6.9x times unfortunately



theres just so few levels that take that long



MAN



some days ago



I was grinding and I choked on level 50



but with my maths it would be close to 4:20.69



it made me very sad



damn



wouldve been a legend come true



yeah it would ;-;



but yeah 29, 32, 39, 42, 45 and 50 are the only ones that are six seconds or more



so the potential pool for a 6.9x is  tiny



;-;



but a x.69 is possible at least



v true



i think 44 could definitely be lowered to 3.69



def, but 44 is a fucking pain



fuck 44



all my homies hate 44



that's like the most beatable IL time that never will be beaten



35 and 36 could probably be shaved by some frames too



but who caaaares



two of the dumbest bullshit tricks in tue game back to back



yeah, no fun, could've at least spaced it out a bit



luckily they only save like .3 each



or else 31-40 would be the hardest split



yeah it doesn't make a big difference



so 44 still 3.80?



3.73



okok



thaks



thanks*



the sheet with all of the new times is pinned



WHERE?



and links to videos of the run w/ the time



the  pin button



in this channel



oooooooohhh



I was at the site



lol thanks



ill grind level 2 maybe i can get the sub

just maybe ;-;



you can def get it



first 10 lvls r rng



man, im grinding, and level 2 aint rng



its pure timing



you have to release the grapple exactly as you swing up and down again



very precise



but thanks for the motivation \:D



yea ur exactly right



but that's what i mean



ooohhhhhhh okok sorry



it's so precise that it doesn't even take skill at that point



it's just luck



yeah, thinking this way



nah nothing to b sry abt



that it by todayim stoping by now



managed to tie the wr 4 times and lots of 2.02s



LOTS of 2.08



im improving at least



gl to y'all



hey guys



I've been away since sunday, anything new that i'm not up to date with?



cyclowns is starting editing on the segmented run



and new guy got 4:10



nice nice



@NewGuy congrats mate



@Klice



^^



im getting close 1.99 i can feel it...



Good luck with it, I'd be impressed if you can do it



1.99 what?



Lvl 2 I think



aaaah yeah that sub 2 fucked



It's soooo close tho, but to hard



> Good luck with it, I'd be impressed if you can do it
@SensualPudding hehe



NEW PBBBBBBB



still shit



but at least is new



4:41



does someone know how to cut videos without any application?



like, online



cause the run i got starts only at 3:55



or a good free video editor



to download



you can trim videos in the default video player on windows



thats what i do



Yeah that’s prolly the easiest way. It’s kind of slow especially on longer videos but idk if any alternative would be faster. Just open the video and hit edit then trim.



im on windows 8



there is the same video editor?



I’m not sure but you can look just open the video file



Prolly similar



im on the windows media player and the only i can edit is the video name



i used a online called clideo



but a native one would be good ;-;



i use a program called lightworks



i think it can do lots of stuff but i only know how to trim and do basics



ºoº



ill download it to see



You can just use an online cutter tool otherwise
Super easy



i did it



clideo is the name



it leaves an watermark



but who cares



> i use a program called lightworks
@rtdrtd67 man, when I search it on google it shows me lots of another editors



can you send the link?



I use online-video-cutter.com. No watermark or anything like that



ºoº



ill give it a look



https://www.lwks.com/ if u want but online cutter sounds easier

{Embed}
https://www.lwks.com/
Lightworks: The professional editor for everyone
Lightworks NLE official webpage



im downloading it, thanks!



i use premiere but that takes a lot of effort to pirate so



yeah, my friend tried, and have to download it 3 times lol



first sub 29, improvement \:D

YES



WOOOOOOOO



feels good to not choke



THIS



damnnn



MAN



GRATS



so quick



congrats



what were ur splits



hold on let me look at recording i dont use autosplit



ya me neither



damnnn



1-10    29.92
11-20   58.98
21-30   1:48.42
31-40   2:41.12
41-50   3:58.17



going in to 41-50 i was 2 seconds behind pb but not dying on 48 and doing fast 50 saved me a ton of time



wow ur 31-40 is p optimal already



and 41-50 not bad either



though there is always time to save on the last split



yeah i do 50 slightly slow at the end to increase my chances of hitting the hyper



and just in general the last split could be polished a lot



need to practice more



i still dont use the hyper on 46 to save about 3 seconds



did u do the 43 hyper



no



i dont even know what that one is i've never tried it



i only use hypers for 24 and 50



and the 50 one is so inconsistent i hate it



same reason i dont use the one on 46 yet



yea the 50 hyper is a bit different



i'd say 43 and 46 generally feel the same as 24



NICE



they j hv tighter windows



4th sub 4?



or



well 4th person



or is it 3rd



4th



towny with the 3:59.9



46 i can get the hyper half the time but hitting right after with perfect timing to make sure i get over the blocks is the hard part



maybe i could try doing the hyper off the right side of the falling block instead of the left



if thats possible



so then i just hold right



the hyper off the right is significantly harder



at least for me



albeit slightly faster



yeah i think i practiced it and then found left was easier to setup



for 10 do you want to get off the platform as soon as possible or as late as possible



ya tbh not sure if it matters



i jump late for some reason



but idk if it actually makes a difference



gotta save that 0.05 second



its whats holding me back



yep



for 1-20



u kinda j get better by doing them a lot



like a lot a lot



i didnt even practice 1 i just reset so much i eventually found out what works



i usually get about 5.4



ya that's how it goes lmao



theres never a skill cap where you dont reset on 1 at least half the time



thats... sad to hear



true



and like 2-4 are just a feel thing trying to get the perfect grapple with the most horizontal speed



its either baby strats or just pure luck



rng game



Congratulations on the sub 4. That was really quick, got some real potential to snatch that wr if you grind a lot

I should start grinding soon, my time is just fucking embarrassing for what I can do



7 sec lv50 just chillin down there in 18th



Exactly 😄
And sub 4 lvl 1

No worries, I'm gonna grind and all of a sudden ill take that wr from nowhere. Be aware



ill grind for wr soon at some point



just got burned out



gg klice, you're improving at a god like clip



nerf klice



i want my bronze disco back



This is the motivation I need to grind again



@Klice congrats on the sub4 mate



\:D



you're improving fast af



i think its because of your experience running another games



experience+grind= ggs



> @LycroP2 da vinchi resolve
@Rebel man "resolve" is a word on portuguese, so for half a second I thought that you were brazillian lol



I was playing GUR in a call with my friend, and then he asked what I was playing and I shared my screen to show it to him, and them he asked:



man did you lose your steam account?



I was like: what do you mean



and them  he says: you have lots of games, why are you playing a flash one



and I was like: ;-; idk



lul



flash is scuffed, but so much great shit was made from it



oh, yessssss



but i understand what he meant



but idk, gur is very fun so why dont play it?



kekekeke



guys, what are your thoughts on GUR 2?



It was alright, but I wouldn't speedrun it



I have played it before, but didnt have the same fun



idk, feels strange



I definitely think the first is superior, probably for it's simplicity



exactly



I didn't like the boss fights in the second one



neither did I



it has so much mechanics, like this is good thing, but it just takes the core of the first



I agree



hey @SensualPudding do you have any news at the resized file? \:D



> @Rebel man "resolve" is a word on portuguese, so for half a second I thought that you were brazillian lol
nahhh im from israel its the name of the program xd



yeah, I searched it after but for a second I was like wut ekekeke



@LycroP2 I haven't started working on it yet, sorry
But you can just press the maximize button on the window. It doesn't centre correctly tho. I think if I wanna make it fullscreen I should make the assets full HD to, otherwise it'll be super blurry



I always maximize the screen, but just like you say it goes to the left



the quality stays ok



the problems are the inumerous resets and resizes lol ksksksk



> @LycroP2 I haven't started working on it yet, sorry
> But you can just press the maximize button on the window. It doesn't centre correctly tho. I think if I wanna make it fullscreen I should make the assets full HD to, otherwise it'll be super blurry
@SensualPudding np my man



I'm pretty busy now for some time but I'll make sure to look at it when I have time.



no problem, im not obligating you to nothing \:)



I think, I'm not sure, but I think. That if you make a shortcut of the swf file. Then you right click that shortcut. There's text box where the file path to the programme is written. After that you should be able to write like -fullscreen or something like that, I don't remember but just search it up. Could be a quick easy solution



WOW



THAT LOOKS PROMISING



LEMME TRY



There's a lot of shit you can do in that field



Don't remember the commands so just search them up somehow



i found this



Stage



like this?



lemme find where do I put this



Could be something like that maybe

Try it



Doesn't hurt to try

Like this I meant



im messing in this



Hope it works



it says that isnt a valid adress



;-;



Did you add in the target field?



yeah



--start-fullscreen



Strange



Can test it tomorrow. Would be good if it worked because its way easier



yeah it would \:D



Do yall think there would be any demand for a tutorial for this game



I don’t feel qualified to make one yet but once I get a little better and learn all of the fast starts I think making one would be fun



I think one of us made one once but it got deleted iirc



I just don’t know if anyone would ever use it lol



Most of the stuff can just be copied from the wr video or the fastest segments



yeah gur is a pretty linear easy to understand game, but there are some tricks that would need explaining, like HSG



fastest segments have a lot of stuff thats extremely not run viable



True



most of us have only gotten the skip in the 36 segment like once or twice



i made a scuffed vid for hsg on 24, 43, and 46



a while ago



I watched it last night



Was helpful for doing the setups a little faster than what I’ve been doing



yeah i made a full tutorial like a year agobut ended up never uploading it and it got deleted at some point



F



i wanna update it since there's so many new strats



and it'd be nice to have a comprehensive guide



whats the meaning of HSG



HYPER SUPER grapple? ekekekekeek



hyperspeed grapple



almost...



its a fun name idr who came up with it



very good name



I like shortening it to hyper but HSG has a nice ring to it too



do you run celeste at all



im thinking cuz hyper is a term in celeste



I looked at his profile on speedrun.com



he does



genius detective.

{Reactions}
🕵️‍♂️ 


Yeah



i ran any% for a little but and got my time down to like 50 mins but i never submitted anything



now i just try and get goldens and play mods n shit



i should prolly run it again



i think in speedrunning it when I buy it



im playing it in a "non-paid" version



if u get what im saying hehe



I think I have 189 berries on my profile. I got all the a sides and all the easy b and c sides. The game is really fun casually and for speed.



And mods are really fun too



> I think I have 189 berries on my profile. I got all the a sides and all the easy b and c sides. The game is really fun casually and for speed.
@Klice ºoº



got all the clips edited together

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/732352793465061427/unknown.png



cropped and hopefully with decent transitions



NOICE



just need to do audio stuff, edit an intro/outro and name cards n stuff



gl man \:D



theres a couple sorta bad transitions but theres not much i can do besides ask ppl for the unedited clip of the level



most of them are good



45->46 is probably the worst one



and its not that noticeable



how much time did the run get?



> and its not that noticeable
@cyclowns thats good \:D



comes in around 3:07 but im missing like 3 levels that i still need to edit from mine



so im guessing itll be around 3:13 or 3:14



which is a couple secs off of the calculated 3:11



holy



3:13 damn



im guessing the transitions arent counted in GUR whereas it is in the actual real time



nice job to everyone that contributed



im almost sure they arent counted in GUR
> im guessing the transitions arent counted in GUR whereas it is in the actual real time
@cyclowns



Yeah, the transition isn't counted so that's the difference there.



not sure how to reconcile that



cuz im gonna have an on-screen timer i think



if i can find a way to stop it durin the transition frames then it'll work fine



just stop the timer in between levels?



itll probably still be some frames off but thatll be a lot more accurate



well some frames off is much better than seconds off



indeed



You know the time of each level. So tht times 60 you know the frame. So just count the fram from you see the first movement



itll be by 30 since i had to standardize each clip to 30fps



since not all of them were 60



i guess i could do frame interpolation but it probably wouldnt look good



Ahh, okay



but yeah i could do that



actually



so i know when to start/stop the timer



It'll take a long time, but either way I think it'll be a great video



i should be able to have it done by the end of the week



unless i run into a hitch



no rush



i *know* it will be a great video 😎 👉 👉 
> It'll take a long time, but either way I think it'll be a great video
@SensualPudding



hopefully it gets like.. any kind of attention outside of our community lol



need more runners



lets hope



A little bit of attention it should be given at the subreddit



oh



we have a subreddit?



nah



just talking about r/speedrun i believe



ohhhhh yes yes



Exactly, the general speedrun reddit



~~be sure to wait for when most of america and western europe is awake to post it~~



yup yup good advice



so 2 am, got it



keekekekekeke



You know I had to do it to em @Klice

For once I didn't choke 47. Explains the gold



they said it was impossible



Also beat 10 time by .01 but I wasn't recording lol. So we know it's improvable at least

there goes one of the few times i have left



It's okay, yours will make it into the segmented video



sure they look identical anyway



Your runs are good tho. 18 is really fast



i remember doing some 18 attempts



and then i just got speed out of thin air somehow and it was fast



Yeah, strange how you got a little boost there from nowhere. I think that record is safe



nah when u exist no IL record is safe



Of course they are🙃
I think I've taken the once I can, the rest are really really hard for me.



congrats @Towny on your new pb \:D



yesssss



competition



man, im training 50 fast and i can pass with ease by the first section, but the second one is so hard aaaaaaa



yeah the 2nd part is super hard



YEP. Had the same problem. It gets easier tho, trust



i hope it does



do you guys have any tips to do it?



on the first grapple try to position the robot close to the pillar so you get a short grapple



ºoº thanks \:D



I found that trying to do it a little fast actually helped my consistency, and I could get a rhythm going. Trying to do it slow felt like it killed the momentum I needed to get through



or if you are having trouble going through the pillars



then the key is to just re-grapple as fast as possible and hold up-left



> I found that trying to do it a little fast actually helped my consistency, and I could get a rhythm going. Trying to do it slow felt like it killed the momentum I needed to get through
@Towny okok ill try



that part is just practice



up-right I think u meant



> then the key is to just re-grapple as fast as possible and hold up-left
@rtdrtd67 lets try it so



oh wait, you mean in trying to re grapple



yea like



if you see the robot is rly close to the next pillar



u can try holding back after the regrapple



I've never successfully been able to do that lol, but it's worth a try. If you are too far to the right with your grapple, you wont make the gap



o that's odd i almost always have to hold back when moving from the 2nd pillar to the last pillar or else i'll hit the bottom part of the last pillar



yeah i just looked at ur PB, I don't think I ever do that



my strat is pure instinct, i just wing it



the short grapple is working, im getting at the first pillar more frequently



now ill use the other tips



Actually looking back to my last run, I totally hold left between the 2nd and 3rd.



Good luck lycro, you got this!



thx \:D



the site looks kinda strange today

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/732691722701766656/unknown.png



Same thing happened to me earlier lmao



there must been some insane wr



and lots of people vistied the site idk



maybe



It's totally cause I beat my pb today



obviously ekekekekekekekeke



So after the segmented run goes out, we should all plan a tournament. I think we have enough people for a small one at least



What does @everyone think about that?



FINALLY MY CHANCE TO BE THE LAST ONE HAS COME!



i agree, good idea, must be hard to organize tho



idk, if we can organize a segmented run, a tournament shouldn't be too hard



just like



everyone does one run at the same time with no resets?



Okay, so we like... pair off like in a bracket



ah



and stream the race



maybe like best 2 out of 3, then winner goes to the next phase



brackets?



hmmmmmm



interesting



i think it ill be very fun with brackets



upper and lower brackets or just one?



Not sure, but there are plenty of ways we could do it



watch me dq myself by failing 1 skip and instinctually refreshing



Lol ye



well



if i dont go against someone good I may have a chance



kekekekeke



so my safe strats will have an use



hmm we could ban 50 skip for the sake of a fair competition



But then again, the inconsistency of 50 skip could lead to some underdog wins



you mean the very end where you gain hyperspeed?



Instead of banning strats better to give one person a handicap prolly



Handicaps based on PB is a good idea, I know of some sm64 tourneys that do that



ºoº



> you mean the very end where you gain hyperspeed?
@LycroP2 ?



> you mean the very end where you gain hyperspeed?
@LycroP2 Like, skipping the block at the beginning, and we could also ban the HSG at the end... But I like the idea of handicaps better



ooooooh okok



because I always felt that the final HSG was very strange



yeah, i like the idea of handicaps



Final HSG has always been mystic to me. For some reason, I never get it in practice, but always get it during runs. It's ethereal



ºoº



he *feels* you're on a run kekeekekekeke



but, which kind of handicaps are we talking about?



Like, one player gets a head start



Tourney sounds fun, and if we can’t get a full on tourney going I’m down to just do races for fun some time



Oh yeah I'm always down for some races



Handicaps would have to be played by ear



> Like, one player gets a head start
@Towny ºoº



We could make a separate text channel for the tournament too. I wouldn't mind doing most of the organizing



talk to @rtdrtd67 them



im down for a tourney



same



So, @everyone if you wanna be a part of the tourney, let me know, and I'll write your name down and probably start planning it some time soon



sign me up



also



and @rtdrtd67 if you wanna make me mod, or just start a tourney text channel that would be cool



o yea tbh i'm not v experienced when it comes to disc servers



sign me in pls



i finished a first draft of the segmented run w/o any fancy editing or anything
just the clips put together and aligned and stuff



so should i j make ppl mod or sth



uploading it rn so you guys can give feedback



@cyclowns pog lets go. I can add post production sound effects cause I know some of the videos were silent



I have premiere so it wouldn't be hard



i think im just gonna make it silent and edit in music



not sure yet



yea



but adding every single sound effect sounds like hell



That works too



since we have the gur files editing in music wouldnt be that hard



im also gonna add some little flourish occasionally probably



like a 'good job robot' at the end of 50



I thought he said good job when you die and stuff



he says give up robot when you die (sometimes)



roll credits



Yeah I noticed a while ago that levels 1-49 she says like "fuck you robot", then at level 50 she says like "I'm sorry" "good job robot" lmao



"give up robot" is definitely a screen finish quote



wait i always heard the 50 win screen as give up



> Yeah I noticed a while ago that levels 1-49 she says like "fuck you robot", then at level 50 she says like "I'm sorry" "good job robot" lmao
@Towny lmao



i recognize "im sorry robot"



i think thats when you continue a save on 50?



i know they have different quotes for continuing saves



I swear one of the quips is "get fucked, robot"



my gf hears it too



you might be mishearing "good jump"



or "give up". Hard to tell with the voice



i cant tell because i mute the game since i finished it like three  years ago



lmao



imagine using sound lol nt



FeelsBadMan



in the files theyre all named some variation of "goobjob" or "giveup"



i use music to time first jump in 1



Same ^



but that doesnt mean they dont say fuck you robot or something



like



its an adult swin game



so i dont doubt anything



true



oh yeah it is



Did anyone watch adult swim back in like 2010? I remember the trailer for this game airing in their 



I was 5 years old in 2010 lol



off the top of my head i can only remember "good job" "good jump" "super jump" "i love you" and laughing



for death quotes



can these even play in discord

it actually does sound like that



Yup, thats the one, lol



im not sure if thats what it is though



It sounds so much like an f though



> I always play with sound on tho
@Towny how???



it really does sound like that

ah



VLC will play anything but MIDI



i always just heard that as give up robot

give your opinions on the transitions/alignment of video/cropping/etc



the video quality for some levels is kinda shit for some reason



not much i can do about that i guess



24 has particles REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE



LOL



24 and 37 have particles



rtd bad



hate to see it



10 and 39 have cursors



i think



and 26



i mean 10s free



rtd u fucking retard lmao



10 isnt free its really annoying



i would not grind it simply for my sanity



we give you a break because you're a literal god at this game tho



about as free as a level can be to tie i mean yea



oh well the particles are a little annoying but idc



doesnt mean its not ass



yo that 22 is fucking crazy



if anyone wants to try tying/beating
10, 24, 26, 36, 37, 39



then be my guest



> 36



that one aint budging



idk why the bitrate is so shit



maybe i encoded it badly



Youtube might not have fully processed hd yet



maybe



if its not either of those things then we're stuck with subpar video quality



which is eh



but this is beautiful though man. Just seeing it all together like this



> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX-f0en4Ocg&feature=youtu.be
@cyclowns its so beautiful ;u;



yeah its really nice to see it all together



i figured out the timer also



WTF IS THIS 45



but that will take effort



these strats are nuts



i think 31 is one of my favorites



it may also just look bad because the game is originally like what... 640 pixels to begin with?



yeaa



and then 50 is just nuts ofc



and a lot of them are scaled up bc streamable only gave me 1280x720



and i had to fit it to 1920x1080



6 22 and 31 are big highlights yeah



31 just because you wouldn't think you could save any time on it



Bro 46 looks like TAS as fuck



^



46 is crazy as well



46 put my two segments before it to shame lmao



nerf sensual please



il god



i have precisely 1 level on here



and its 3



i have precisely 0



lets go



and its not even that optimized i tried for like 3mins to get it



lol did you not even do the other ones you claimed



i did do the otehr ones



they just got beaten



ah



F



50 IS FUCKING NUTS



yep



Cyclowns, there are still room for improvements



that 9 is also sick



like 10 can be improved .01



if you beat me to it



good job of everyone that participated youre nuts



50 looks kinda bad cus it was clearly a first attempt on sensual's level select swf



so it starts moving before screen transition



which mightve fucked with the timing actually



yeah that sorta sucks



but im not gonna ask him to redo 50



unless he wants to i guess



yeah fat fucking chance it ever gets beat



if he even can. That was god like



Idk what they're feeding him over in sweden, but he's transcended normal human capacity for sure



timer is currently 10 seconds off



time is around 3:12 and its giving me 3:22



but i figured out the timer and how to start/stop it



so were good now i just need to painstakingly set keyframes for every single level



which i am going to do tomorrow because im tired



thats fair



Thanks for the work you're putting in cyc



its not too much work



im glad i had the idea of the segmented run in the first place tho



i just got a sick bug on the il retry swf



the 10 platform is moving back and forth infinitely



Yeah that happens lol



are you using the old one



that was a bug on it



uh



or is it a bug on gur trainer



its the one on src



no its the il retry



yeah the old swf also just freezes when youre about to die sometimes



is trainer better?



yeah gurtrainer is way better



aight sick



i thought that one was on src



it is



ah



its IL retry but with level select and few bugs



I have to use the older version of gurtrainer, cause my controller stalls at the start



sensual: insane mechanics: his PB 4:41



me: horrible mechanics My PB 4:41



@SensualPudding wtf?



i think he just hasnt tried for PB that much



and goes for IL records



^



he should try



it would be a very good time



VERY good time



i mean no guarantee he didnt just grind ils for half an hour per :brother:



🤔



Part of doing full runs too is learning to handle pressure



I’m gonna watch this when I get home in 45 minutes it sounds sick



That's something you gotta grind on it's own



yeah



especially if you do 50 skip



^



literal tas strats at the very end of the run



yeah boi



Isn’t the 50 like 7 seconds



yeah its crazy



Jesus



i think like 7.7 seconds



iirc 7.77 exactly



literally the god run



yeah lmao



just checked 41-50 on the sheet

nerf this man



i thought at least 46 wouldve been like rtd still



literally INSANE



i think he wants to see how much will his PB improve if he trains each individual level



as an experiment k=



i mean i was nowhere close to sub 28 1-10 then after grinding ils and coming back i got it in like 20 mins of grinding



i also golded 11-20 twice cus my 12 strat before il's was Bad



What ya'll mean with improving my PB and stuff. There's no need, I have the best PB and I'm so proud over it



LMAO fair enough



i am close

yeah guys it's called personal "best" not personal "needs improvement"



im on a quest to remove cyclowns from their own video



o shit



alright i'm gonna try beating those lvls



but that 24 looks p good



the others are doable though



6 is improvable if you can frame perfect that boost



for now it's finalized



unless ppl tie or beat
10, 24, 26, 36, 37, 39



since those have like cursors or particles or are cut wrong



got level 10



:o



I think 10 is now frame perfect



wdym now



I don't think we can get lower than where it's at



just got 2.97



:SKULL:



so whats the trick



Pressing the button super fucking fast

You can see how fast im pressing it



and releasing equally fucking fast



i always wait and react to when i can first see the robot but that depends on reaction speed



second jump os required



makes sense



dont know why i did the middle jump in that vid lol



saved six and a half days worth of frames



i got 3



1.95



dont know what i did differently but



Get fucked cyclowns



cyclowns has a total of 0 segments



rekt



f's in chat boys



wait... 1.77 on level 8? Or level 3

😆 (2) 


hahahaha



and yea klice what level are you talkin about w 1.77's



oops



1.97



same thing



i only see last digit



only one that matters



lmao



but yea w this kinda shit it doesnt matter much what you do different



its just grind til you get a different number



Seems like that some times



grinding 20 felt more like luck than a lot of the rest of them tbh



exception of 30 obviously fuck 30



huh i would think 20 would feel like less luck



bc its longer and more complex



than a lot of other levels



its complex but it doesnt feel like there can be any real variation in what you do



or you die



so getting 4.5x's constantly to a 4.2 is ???



am i supposed to edit the doc and where do i submit clip



just dm it?



you edit the doc yeah



i feel that



upload the recording to streamable and link it on the box with the time



a good feeling one will be slow and an average one will pb and youre just ???



yeah thats how 30 felt



i was grinding for 1.21



and right after i got it i reset to do other levels



and got a random ass 1.18 off recording



so i grinded for 1.18



and the same thing happened with 1.15



and then sensual told me he tied the 1.15 but with a worse angle



so like  1.12 is probably possible???



but no ones gotten it



@Klice Link the streamable video to the doc



or just send it here, and I can do it



can i just mention



25.44



I know. I've never seen a 26.xx and I never fucking will



That's quick as fuck. Sub 26,thought it was impossible



cyclowns timer being 10 seconds off makes me think the actual time might be more than just the sums of the ils

@Towny is the king of 1-10 so gotta thank him for that



Yeah well he counts the transition time as well, the in game timer doesn't count that



Thank you, thank you... I do it for the fans, thank you



lmao



i used to be the king of 31-40 but then yall got strats



still holding the frame perfect 34 strong



The true king is SensualPudding for his amazing level 11



true true



Exactly my 11 is hard to beat



Speaking of 11 is your horizontal speed affected by being in the air at all



Pretty sure no



Vs grounded



the fact that ive never seen a fluctuation in 11 times tells me no



I don't think it is



> https://streamable.com/s9000z
@Towny wait how do you play with a controller?



If anyone beats my 11 you can officially have all my times for free. Won't fight



this is still the peak of the server

I remember that



Legendary



The fact that Doggo uses light mode just degrades the picture and your over all gamer-Ness so much



i live for the pain of everyone who sees my screenshots



My eyes are burning from all the exposure



I'll Just interrupt here with a quick question, now when we have tried and seen a lot of tricks and IL times. What would you guys think the theoretical best would be with the current knowledge of tricks?



Haha, love that "former wr holder BTW" comment



call cyclowns he's crying



arcanod cant beat our splits either



> I'll Just interrupt here with a quick question, now when we have tried and seen a lot of tricks and IL times. What would you guys think the theoretical best would be with the current knowledge of tricks?
@SensualPudding I would say currently we could save a few seconds or so. But most of that is from insane levels like 50 that are gonna be hard to get perfect



Okay okay. I'd think a few sec as well. I mean just .2 seconds on all the levels are still a second. So if a TAS would be able to calculate the best rount and perform at the best I'd think we'd be close to the 3 min mark



More then a second. How's my math

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/732744183269425253/unknown.png



There are tricks I could do with a tas that would improve time. Like getting a boost by quickly grappling a wall and releasing



u not see this



Yup, I see that. Just curious overall



I foresee a sub 3 some time in the future. Once elevator skip is discovered



isnt my 3 1.95



i dont think that beat it



It said 1.97 on the board. No video linked



I thought your were 1.97



oh



it is 1.95 im pretty sure



i edited it in like 2 hrs ago



But now when you say it I thought you got 1.95 on a stream



either way im not gonna update any times cuz i dont want people to break like 10 records in the next couple days and make me have to change all of em



specifically unless they beat the ones with issues



I beat 10, cyclowns



there was like 2 months to beat the other times



oh nice



no more cursor



Yup, totally understandaböe that you won't update them

I'll probably still come back once in a while to get the total down



now we just gotta beat 39



which honestly doesnt seem that hard



I'm not doing 39 again. God its boring



it seems like a huge pain in the ass to grind for IL



But not to hard to beat no



Oh man I just noticed the cursor



cringe



We have all these crazy tricks and shortcuts now that can bring the wr down by half a minute. That's a long time for such a short game. So the potential for improvement is huge and the skill level is high. But as we see with like some top players we don't need all those tricks to get high. The skill level is high but I would argue that so is the case for luck. I think that we could just for fun have an 'as intended' category or something. Then the consistency and skill of the game, not the tricks, would be the focus. I also think that would shine a light on how important the small things are, instead of the big fancy skips. I know that if I want to start grind sometime I'll do that at least, because those small normal things is just as important to me, if not more important



Like, a glitchess category?



Exactly, glitchless. But maybe even skip less to some extent, like 50 or 29



I got way carried away writing that



man, like



a glitchless category for GUR is a little hard



cuz HSG is sometimes unintentional



like imagine u r on a run a with no intention do a HSG



would u need to reset?



of course :/



That's true. Could be hard like that



Just think that new players checking in might be overwhelmed and give up because they can't make it anywhere



man, its like mirrors edge



the any% is full of glitches



and they made a "glitch-less" run



because there's still some gltiches



cuz some glitches happens a lot and dont change much cuz they're small



if you have time to, watch a mirrors edge any% and then a glitchless



u will se thats there plenty of glitches yet



theres a really good video about this



wait a minute

8 minutes, very funny video



I think we can copy a bit from them then. As long as the glitch doesn't change the time by to much it shouldn't be removed



and explains what im trying to say



I'll take a look at it



but, what are the glitches in GUR?



HSG and what?



if its only HSG  there´s no way to just remove some



> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsu4miYMWo
@LycroP2 just to be clear, they arent fighting, just making a fun joke that the glitchless is full of glitches



I mean HSG isn't intentional and every level can be done without it. Sometimes you just happen by it in like 20 or something. But those times can be ignored.
I know for a fact that if I had arrived today and not years ago I wouldn't have begun. Because of 50 and HSG and stuff like that



the thing is: if there are irregularities in the rules, someone is going to abuse them



thats why most games have strict rules about glitchless and some dont even have glitchless



I understand that those can be terrifying to see for a new player, but when I ask people about games taht are ful lof glitches they say that started not doing any of them, and them learning all together



is a thing that takes times



I see da point. I'll lay it on ice for now sence there isn't to much shit. But if we discover 1 or 2 more glitches I defenetly think it should be added



Yeah, i would like a glitchless, but for now we must discuss the rules more strictly



@cyclowns Matched 26 with no particles



Pinned a message.



lemme try for the other lvls



time to derust



Shit I just beat 26 but wasn't recording



fml



how do u go forward and back lvls on gurtrainer again?



it's been too long



WAIT I WAS RECORDING



YES



> how do u go forward and back lvls on gurtrainer again?
@rtdrtd67 SHIFT and BACKSPACE



Shit, fast 26,thlught that was almost perfect



hm backspace is working but shift doesn't



o it's tab



lowered by .01 pogchamp



beat 24 by .02



Wait, wasn't that rtds?
Did you take another from him?



Oh, we're on a roll here. Lower by soooo much



@cyclowns Matched 37



niceee



i've been attempting that one



can't match it



I think it can be improved



thanks for that



yea prob sub 4 is possible



beat 38



@cyclowns all the particles lvls hv been cleared



now just 39



nice gj



what is this glitchless talk?



because if we are to ban hsg and do a new category I think this should be included

Something interesting in Give up, Robot
I have no idea what I've just brought up on this cursed land. I have no idea what this is, why it even happens, if it's useful, or how I would even describe it. Getting hyperspeed-yeeted backwards by pressing "up" doesn't happen every day. Not for me atleast. But it surely is ...
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fey2Rm0HNk8/maxresdefault.jpg



not that it's doable, viable, or useable



just it's unintented and once we reach perfection levels, it might have some kind of potential



a "skipless" category would need very defined rules on what counts as a skip or not



is 1 a skip?



is 29 a skip?



also nice beating the particles levels



im down for having a category like that but it needs to be well defined



What are we going to call this trick @hetheis?



what about "UCB" - "unintented ceiling boost"



what's particles levels?



It's not a ceiling trick though. Check out this vid, I actually got it to work twice in a row. This has potential

witchcraft right there



It seems to work like it shoves you back for a frame or two when you grapple close to a wall



and if you release in time, you can capture the momentum



Wtf, that had crazy potential



Can you do it free falling ot you have to be at the ground?



You can do it in the air



At least im pretty sure



That's crazy fucking fast



feels harder to do in the air



And looks like it doesn't have as much preparation or needs as the HSG



Probably is, but would be good if it wprked



Holy shit



You can use it for level 5



I just saved a tenth of a second



Can probably do much more



uploading video now



I think the name of the video "grapple boost" would work



as the name for the trick



well shit



This is really impressive



new trick



how would you use it for level 5?



you could use it on 29 to skip the platform moving



wouldnt you hit the lava in the ceiling tho?

😮 (3) 


Yeah, 29 would be a good save



and 5 can be improved more



can you do the trick of the spinner?



Down to 2:52 now



Idk why i never saw the potential in this shit



how about on 32 to skip falling down to the spinner



this seems like it has potential to do a lot so ill postpone the segmented run by like



idk a week



ill just work on the editing the intro and namecards n stuff



I'm not available to do so much this week, could we do 2



if we think there's more levels to have time saved that haven't been done then sure



@Towny what inputs are u doing



I think we can use it in like 10 levels at least to some extent



Hold up next to a wall, the press z and x at the same time and release at the same time frame perfect, then quickly press the direction opposite to the wall to capture the momentum



faster level 5 now



https://streamable.com/eattii



im thinking
3, 5, 6?, 14?, 20?, 23, 28?, 29, 32, 36?, 38?, 45?, 49?



as maybe timesaves



but i would need to try it out



just got a 2.77 on 6



this is pretty huge



niice



im gonna try it out rly quick



@here cuz this is pretty huge



do we have confirmation that it works on like the normal SWF



and not just the gur trainer swf



yeah, I've done it on regular



nice



2.65 on level 6



Sub 25 1-10



i have no idea if im doing this right



i guess ill find out if i get it once



its all in the release timing



im getting it like 10-20 percent of the time



so likely not viable for RTA



unless it saves a lot of time



or maybe if its practiceable



i guess we'll see



True, I might try it on 1-10 just for a free gold



now i wanna try and get a sub 27 1-10



It's definitely RTA viable if you can get the boost



first time ive ever used the X key for something



Do you have to use both



Sub 25 1-10 LETS GOOOO



we did it boys



This is my favorite new meta



i still havent gotten it once



i just press and release z/x super fast and hold opposite and hope it works



Try facing a wall, hold up and towards the wall, and just spam z and x. On some of them you'll probably bounce back. That's the timing you want



That might help you get the timing down



do you have to hold up/towards while doing it for it to work



You have to hold up, holding towards isn't required, but I still do it, in case i fail I go right up back to the wall



i did it



hell yeah



Nice!



man thats a really fun trick



i would fucking hate to have to do that in RTA



I know right?



im getting more consistent with it



if i practice it enough ill probably get the timing down though



can you do in the air



im guessing no because you cant jump in the air



> can you do in the air
@cyclowns yes but if you're falling down you wont be able to get much horizontal speed



oh wow it does kinda work



You can jump up, and try to nail it on the apex



i did it in the air by spamming



woah I just thought of something



This would be filthy to pull off, but if you grapple right before you attempt it on a wall, it will kill you vertical speed for a second



It could totally be doable on any wall



I gotta try it out



does the horizontal speed vary at all



It seems that way but im not sure



im trying to get it on 23 but doing it in the air i fall down before i can hit the other side



perhaps it depends on when you hold the direction to capture the momentum



it also looks like you have to hold towards the wall in the air for it to work



nah, you don't have to



it only works that way for me



oh man i still hv not gotten this once



i am not very consistent with it

huh



idk what im doing differntly then



you can potentailly save time at the end of 28 confirmed



but it would have to be very fast



Bro just improved 22



Check this shit out

oh 29 thats huge!



Bro this segmented run is going to look to sick



i wish i could get it on the moving platform but idk



I'll check it out



i think you would just fly off of it into the abyss



All the levels will just be launch



sub 3 segmented run



i wanna see it



It'll be like those portal speedrun



if you add a clip to the semgneted run bold it or color it with red or something so i know its a new clip



i got a 6.68 on 29 and it was super unoptimized



so i think i can save time on it



Here's a proof of concept

oooo



i didnt think to jump off of it after



that'll save so much on 32



that probably saves more time on 32



yea



cool ima grind this out



i might be able to use 2 of them on 29



one to boost right off of the moving platform



then to boost left past the lava

level 28 swag



the moonwalk



i dont think i can beat 29 without serious swag strats



man this trick is so ridiculously hard



Yeah RTA viability is pretty low



probably 32 is the best lvl



u can miss it a bunch and most likely still save time



i'm finding this jump quite annoying to time tho



just got 32



you can do it off of lava blocks too



by the way



just have to be really close



Saved an entire second on 32



damn



see this is the kind of trick you'd abuse in a TAS



for sur



dam only save 1-1.5 secs on 32



it's a lot but i thought it'd be more



idea

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/733037319313031178/unknown.png



possible. I got the right side boost, but didn't beat sensuals time



That would be extreme to pull of



I'm just too slow at the first part



yeah i can get the one on the right b ut i can only get like 6.2 with it



I think the second face is slower with the boost vs my timw



Just because you loose so much on the swing and first section



Woah guys, this trick works for ceilings too



👀



im about to send a vid



in what way



i just tied 34 by accident



not even with the trick i just did it



Yeah I was trying 34, and found this

It works on ceilings I guess



well then



it seems a lot easier with the ceiling



like I feel like im getting it like half the time



i wonder what the reason is for the varying speed



like sometimes i get an insane amount and sometimes i just get a lot



probably depends on when you hold the direction



If you're a frame late, it will give you friction



and slow you down



yea maybe



by hold direction you mean hold right



in most cases



yeah unless you're doing level 29 I guess



yep



wow this trick is rly killin my right hand



Got 23



we've saved like 2 and a half seconds so far with this trick



That's huge, why didn't we notice this before
Good job Towny



When I found the boost trick I didn't think it was RTA viable. Forgot about it when the segmented run happened



Glad you posted your video discovering it, or I wouldn't have remembered



saved .01 on level 29 lol

Got a little boost at the beginning



bro please



pretty limp first grapple though



hi merpell 👋



seen the new trick today?



yes



looks stupid



lmao definitely not RTA viable, but the segmented run is gonna look crazy



yep



in the future 32 could b rta viable



loses like .7 if missed and saves 1.2 if gotten



Just got a 5.57



on 32



damn wasn't recording



fml



so more potential time save doing it fast



okay now i got a 5.15



and was recording



It can save a lot if done right

cleeeeeaaan



got a 5.03 on 23 so if 32 is the same level it should be able to go that low too

btw its down to 4.95



Regular wallkicks like level 29 are a little more consistent. Maybe 1 in 5



id say 29 is worth trying in runs



o rly my consistency sucks with regular wallkicks



maybe i don't understand it well enough



It's all in the timing. I would find a wall and just practice releasing at the right time. You'll fly back if you get it right



do you need to jump or no?



for regular wallkicks



You don't need to



but for something like 29, you would need to to be able to get over the laval



lava*



ah right



on 29 that's an air wallkick right



just very close to the ground



No you need to land so you can jump



mmm i see



yea my consistency is atrocious



gonna leave this one out for now



WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT



hi doggo you missed alot



clearly???



i slept for like 10h



We shaved off like 4 seconds using the new trick today



yall r voodoos



The wallkick meta is unreal



lmfao



surprised none of my times got scathed



it could def be used in 45



but it wouldn't save much



actually you could use it at both the start and end



but it would be aids



it would be very aids lol

activate second block, hsg to the left wall, wall boost and jump off the second block



i saw 22



everything after the boost sucked too which is fuckin insane



how it still saved like a full second



i know, right? Someone who is good at 22 needs to top it

new wallkicks strats bro



buckle up, this game will never be the same



OMG



now ill sink into the leaderboards ;-;



can someone explain me how to do it



Trust me, these strats are definitely not viable for runs



cause im trying as you said earlier



but this shit is hard



its really inconsistent



super inconsistent



oh



try to hold up and towards a wall, and just practice the timing



this might create a big discrepancy on the times



if you get the timing right, it will push you back



> this might create a big discrepancy on the times
@LycroP2 Probably not, there are limited uses for it. We've only shaved off 4 seconds of the segmented run so far



i i have to move to the opposite direction after i release z and x?



> @LycroP2 Probably not, there are limited uses for it. We've only shaved off 4 seconds of the segmented run so far
@Towny thanks god



yeah once you get the boost, you hold the direction opposite the wall



and you can blast off



lets try



its all in the timing of z and x. There an input display on that video if you wanna analyze it



but it is super inconsistent. I only get it maybe 1/10 times. Probably less



is wallkick their name now



i am a fan of it



Yeah I've just been calling them wallkicks



im only getting little boosts



lemme try it more



Little boosts probably mean you aren't changing your direction fast enough



yeah, i think thats because in keyboard is harder to do it



cause you have to release your finger from the wall direction



towny using an NES controller finally pays off



he can do wallkicks easier



while in controler you just changing



> towny using an NES controller finally pays off
@cyclowns isnt it a xbox 360?



I have a dualshock now lol



oh



same difference



its a logitech dualshock knock-off



i used to use nes controller tho lol. Those were the days



its weird cuz i usually play platformers with a controller



hat in time and celeste i usually did with dualshock



but GUR i dont think i could switch



THIS IS HARD AF AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



yep



ill try later with my xone controller



> THIS IS HARD AF AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
@LycroP2 YEP. I spent half of today just getting the timing down



which program do you use towny?



to map it



I use JoyToKey



ill download to try a bit later



👍  Controller gang!



im gonna start editing the segmented run intro a bit



im gonna have it go like



title + explaining the game/run -> explaining HSG and wallkicks with visuals -> showing all players -> run actually starts



I imagine what sensual Is going to do when he discovers it



lol yeah sorry about discovering a new trick and changing half the levels like the second you finished the draft



KEKEKEEKEKEKEKE



eh it doesnt make a big difference



at max itll change like 10 levels



most of the work comes from editing the timer to work + editing the fancy bits



putting the clips together only took me like 2hrs



luckily theres still too little to work with in 11



i forgot what bet i made with the first person to find 11 skip



first born child?



i think that was sensual



Just wait until I find floorkicks



lmfao



those are called jumps



lol



downward facing grapple



imagine being able to grapple at any angle



Hyper extended inverted vertical floor kick



> imagine being able to grapple at any angle
@cyclowns That would make for an interesting game. Like, you could use your mouse to determine where the grapple extends



or at the very least using arrow keys to point the grapple in like 8 directions or somethin



like how celeste does dashes



give up robot but the robot can actually move his grapple



new mod time



Modding flash 4weird

a unicycle

this is level 6



so it should in theory be easy to edit levels



or create custom levels

wouldnt even need swf hacks



MAN I JUST THOUGHT TODAY



On a super hard give up robot version



like the mario odissey superstar mode



what a day my friends



what a day



im gonna try making a custom level really quick



yo i added :pog:



see if it works



add the robot as an emote



wait i think anyone can add



fun fact: in the same day that sensual tought about a glitchless category towny discovered a new glitch 👍



> wait i think anyone can add
@cyclowns how do i do this

Give Up Robot custom levels would be so poggers



> fun fact: in the same day that sensual tought about a glitchless category towny discovered a new glitch 👍
@LycroP2 If he hadn't brought it up I wouldn't have experimented with it. Cause we both technically discovered the glitch independently from each other, but I just forgot about it until he mentioned it



didnt hetheis find it a while ago



and we just never did anything with it



also



level editing



works



and its amazing



and also not super hard to do

i might create a super rudimentary level editor



that sounds like a fun project



> didnt hetheis find it a while ago
@cyclowns Shit, yeah I meant hetheis



> that sounds like a fun project
@cyclowns it does



man[



im trying playing with a controller



Also pog to that level editing



its a little strange at first



but it can be cool



now i have a bunch of stupid level ideas



and the glitch still ahrds



hard



time to make a proof of concept



and look

I legit can not play with a keyboard lol. I tried a bit ago and couldn't do any tricks and I died a lot lol



man



wel



its all trining

towny



did you messed with your sensitivity?



cuz mine looks VERY high



or any other config



sensitivity? with what, it's all analog



no like



dead zone



sorry



Yeah I use the D-Pad on my controller



cuz if i lightly touch my anlog ROBOT GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR



> Yeah I use the D-Pad on my controller
@Towny oh ;-;



ill try it



well



no controller for me



i cant play on the d pad



Is it not mapping?



or is it just too weird feeling



weird



VERY weird



and also, i prefer ps4 dpad than xbox



xbox controlelr is better than ps4, but the dpad is no competition



ps4 dpad is better



to me, the keyboard feels too weird to play on lol. But I guess it depends on how you learn it



its understandable



i just created the best level ever



Show us

man



at least i got mroe knowledge about how the level format works



my 1-30 was always around 1:50



i turned game timer



i got as 1:43



wtf



i think i pressured me too much looking at the timer



in theory if you edit all the right places you should be able to add levels past 50



but in lieu of that, just editing the level files that alraedy exist is enough



what the actual fuck is happening

That's the worst level to die on



;-;



among the other 10.00+ second levels



dying at the end of 39, 42 or 45 are the most painful possible deaths



> That's the worst level to die on
@Towny rip



because they're all braindead easy and like 20 seconds long



actually the most painful possible death was my death at the literal last pixel of 50 on my 3:38 pace run



im still sad about that

man

@cyclowns I would gonna be so pissed



what a blueball



that for real hurt me



Fs on the chat for our boi cyclowns



F



that woulda been like 3:38.5



which i think would be wr



We need a F emote



yeah it would



man, playing with timer off is so relaxing



its really nice



i usually practice with timer off



because otherwise im constantly staring at the timer



thinking now, playing with the timer (for me) was like someone was shouting on my ear: GO FAST MODAFOCKA AAAAAAAAAAA



> because otherwise im constantly staring at the timer
@cyclowns exactly



i honestly think i could play 1-20 blindfolded because im always staring at the timer anyway



😳 dudeisnuts



> i honestly think i could play 1-20 blindfolded because im always staring at the timer anyway
@cyclowns that explains why im liking to play without it, i think i pay more attention in the game idk



because i'm addicted at looking that damn timer



and also when i'm doing well i see at the timer and i get happy and die



lol



if we take another 1.8-1.9 seconds off of the segmented run



we will have officially taken a full minute off of arcanod's run



thats a milestone



now that we have like the new glitch and we're actually pretty close to sub-3 i'm gonna give evry1 like 1-2 weeks to submit stuff



then ill finish up the video with what we have



if you set a new time color the cell in the spreadsheet yellow or something so i know to update it



:towny:



LMAO



do one of these for level 50 lol



so when someone fail it just send this "gif"



make one of my death on level 50



NICE idea



keekekekeke



probably couldnt make it 256kb without putting it through a hydraulic press



just the end part



of cyclowns dead run



there's a gta5 speedrunner thtat i like watching, his name is darkviperau, and when he dies at the run, there's a meme of spamming "run's dead" emote



when I saw cyclowns death



i just could think at chat spamming run's dead



lol



hey, u guys should put the wallkick at the #guides channel i think



wallkick*



yeah we should probably use that channel



yeh



i gotta say wallkicks are really annoying but theyre super satisfying to do

ooohh they're



oh god does doing 3 wallkicks in 22 save time over falling through the blocks

{Reactions}
🤔 


i was thinking that



🤔



doing the 3rd wallkick requires a super precise jump as well



couldnt you just do it from super high up



you'd still need to jump off to get height though



i think



or else you'd go into the lava



i seriously doubt doing 3 wallkicks saves time



maybe unless its like tas level wallkicks



and theyre instant



probably will save like 0.13 seconds



some very non worth shit



thats it by today, bye sorry for annoying you guys with so  many messages nave a good night



wait i forgot of the \:D



\:D



sleep well



thanks!



the new trick on 23 and 32 actually look like wavedashes in celeste lol



i was thinking that yea lol



but it only looks like that if you jump

based and mario-pilled ^



lmfao



The new wallkick, do we know the speed or any think like it?



And do we know how it works?
Is it that you're in a block at the game pushes you out. Or is it that you get the speed the grapple would otherwise have because you let go do fast



Because if we know how it works, maybe vertical kicks are possible as well instead of just horizontal



dont think anyone knows why it works



hetheis just found it by spamming grab



wall clip theory sounds a lot more sensible than the other one



Thought the clip sounded right, a good test is probably if it worked with lava. If it didn't I think it's clip. I really hope for a vertical boost



youd have to clip into the floor wouldnt you



~~also wens hardmode segment~~



Yeah, or a corner maybe



> ~~also wens hardmode segment~~
@Doggo yeah, we need that to



That could be real quick, but hard



> And do we know how it works?
> Is it that you're in a block at the game pushes you out. Or is it that you get the speed the grapple would otherwise have because you let go do fast
@SensualPudding Im assuming when you grapple a wall while holding up, the game pushes robot back, and if you release on the frame it pushes him back, the game will preserve that speed



> @SensualPudding Im assuming when you grapple a wall while holding up, the game pushes robot back, and if you release on the frame it pushes him back, the game will preserve that speed
@Towny so my second theory, if so it would work on lava walls as well, right? Does it work on lava or spinners?



Spinners, probably not, since spinners would spin you on contact instead of pushing you back... I think. But if you could get close enough to a lava wall without actually touching it, maybe... That would be some TAS shit though



I might try it out today



Wall clip strats being organized POG



Okay, because the difference is important. I really hope its the game clipping. But a lava launch would probably be useful in some places



:pog:



if theres a vertical wallkick clip i will learn just to use it at level 39



I wouldn't count on any clipping being found yet



I hope one day we can find elevator clip though



well, if we discover vertical wallkick...



we are skipping the elevators basically



Usually it's easier to clip moving things so maybe one day



> we are skipping the elevators basically
@LycroP2 on level 23 and 32



We would need a situation where the game pushes you up, but you cant grapple below you so... idk how that would work



actually, maybe if we were already boosted up through HSG, it might be possible... But that would be hard to set up RTA



I'm gonna test if wallkicking off lava is possible



@SensualPudding can now confirm that lava wallkicks are possible

I think that besides Brazil, only Guiana and French Guiana dont speak spanish

ya i always input jump just in case



so probably just hit the ground



also rtd ffs turn off particles if you're submitting times lol



That 22 is good but cyc wants them without particles. You can probably get a faster wallkick though so it's still improvable



o shit ye



i keep forgetting



i'm goin for sub 4 anyway



end was bad



good luck!



i kept dying on the jump after the wallkick on 22



i just realized it's because i'm pressing x while still holding up



so i can't get a short hop



I expect a sub 4 on my desk by tomorrow



look now

{Reactions}
pog (2) 


LETS GOOOOOOOOOO



1.1 seconds save on 22, amazing



somehow my 22 consistency is way better than 23/32



sometimes i overshoot the platform on 23 and 32



yea there's that



there's more lenience on the wallkick height in 22



and more time to react



> And do we know how it works?
> Is it that you're in a block at the game pushes you out. Or is it that you get the speed the grapple would otherwise have because you let go do fast
@SensualPudding  I Think it has something to do with the minimum length your grapple can be, and then the game detects your grapple is shorter and then extends it. Then by realesing at the right time you can keep the momentum. But if thats not the case i seriously have no clue



@hetheis Yeah I think that's exactly whats happening



Btw what is this tournament?



Just something I'm thinking about organizing. Like we all race each other



Sick



Yeah, it probably is that case sence the lava worked. If that's the case the speed should be the same as the normal grapple speed, nice information for this nerd. CALCULATIONS



rtd 3:38.87



complete with :towny:

did you get 32 wallkick i tabbed out



nah i didn't attempt



that one is too hard

guys if I did a stream



and I took a drink for every reset



how fast would I die



yo rtd



i love you being cautious to avoid the towny 47



then you get the towny 47 anyway LOL



also you'd be dead after my runs for sure towny



i mean if you just accepted getting over 5 mins every other run



then you could end sober



accepting a 1 fail every other run would be harder than that tbf



ya that 47



you do hate to see it



i released my grapple about a year too early



this run without the deaths would prob be ~330 or low 331



3:2x is still kinda far



You got the towny 47 bro RIP

He used tricks years ago



Wait, he did section 2 of level 50 in one sweep 7 years before I knew it even were possible



yeah



it seems like hes the first person recorded to discover it



hes also the first person recorded to discover 22 skip



like seven years before david made his wr improvements post



he didnt find the bonk strat for 22 though that was cyclowns

my favorite ones i put are 'towny ballmer peak' and 'he gave up'



as well as uint(uint(uint( because i think i'm the only person that actually understands that



unless sensualpudding does



is it some gibberish in the code that the swf editor shows



after i edit anything in submitmenu.as the editor adds like 20 uint casts to every variable

And then he was drunk lol

and we fucked around in vc



damn boe, must've been fun \:D



> rtd got world record
@Doggo which time?



3:35



holy



congrats @rtdrtd67 \:D



but yeah we did some races



and also found out that at least two people got sub 4 seven years ago



and never submitted to src



mastin and who?



he mentioned in the description that he beat the wr by "0.21 seconds"



holy



i think they didnt submit cuz



before



there was the adult swin leaderboard



and well



GUR didnt exist on speedrun.com yet



lol



gur was added in 2010



but ive never heard of an adult swim leaderboard



did it have times? or just scores



> but in the site it says it has only been added in 2015 to speedrun.com



the game is from 2010, but only added to speedrun.com in 2015



the times older than this, @merpell  put they in the sitee



oh is that what the year means



yeeeah



i thought the year here was the date it got added

makes sense



cuz merpell found the videos but they dont have profiles



on speedrun.com



but yea we found mastin on kongregate



and he seems to be semi active there



still?



damn boe



so cyclowns is tryna get him back into running lol



YAHOOOOO



Experts coming in play



literal tasbot



youve seen his hardmode wr right



mastin new HARD game run is fucking nuts



i remember seeing the new game times and thinking



well, if i cant beat these times



ill try on hard mode



LOL



then I saw his run



I was like



:slep:



damn boe this dude is GUD



if we do a super hard mod of GUR



it should be called



GIT GUD ROBOT



eekekekekek



Sup lycro if u wanna watch some of the races u can check towny’s twitch VOD



can I?



yahoo



thats good hehe



ill watch it



sup rtd (forgot to say it lol)



hey



do you guys think a "least grapples" category would be cool? idk cuz the game dont have much mechanicx besides this, but it would be cool for beginners I think



least grapples i mean like the least portals on portal 1 and 2



> beginners



tell that to 2-grapple 29



srry misspelled



no you spelt it right



but the cat would be brutal as fuck to even do normally for beginners



the right is beginner



much less speedrun



1 might require a wallkick lmao



no, like



least possible grapples



yeah im aware



there are some that are necesary



i didnt think much at this at all



just said to see what u guys think



Interesting category



But definitely not for beginners



Lvls 24, 43, 46 would require hsg



yeah it could be neat but it would be impossible for those typesa people



Same as end of 50



50 too



yeah



you dont get to do 50 skip at least



but dont even bring up 29



Ye 29



I’ve never even done it in 2 grapples



> Lvls 24, 43, 46 would require hsg
@rtdrtd67 yeah, thinking this way



wow im dumb, now i remembered that the portal one is super hard



lemme chart this actually



srry for being dumb lol



but it would be interesting, grind for news strats



to start with, the leaderboard would be as who finished the game in less grapples is first



and then, if both finished with the same ammount go to the time



what u guys think?



oh jesus christ 39



39 is probably???? possible in 4



but this is gonna take a while

ive grinded this strat for probably an hour total and ive gotten it once



daammn boe



now i get it



well, we will have to grind hehe



so the first number on the least grapples leaderboard 61, Doggo!



can I make a fixed message with this "leaderboard"?



i dint do 29 43 44 or 46



i just know that those are the numbers



okok, so when someone do it, i'm asking permission to do the fixed message \:D



lol



but by now i think we should only count the tries that pass the levels



like, if a level needs 2 grapples and you die 3 times in it



the other ones shoudn't count



yea so by the time someone gets a 61 the wr is jsut gonna be a game of how long you sit in 44 for



eekekekekekekekeke



honestly if 44 didnt exist it could be a cool category though



20 and 39 were unexpectedly precise



serious?



yeah 20 has a pretty tight swing



damn boe



congrats on doing it and studying the category in less than an hour \:D



how many levels needed a wallkick?



or none?



none



i cant imagine a wallkick shaving grapples off any of them



yeah, make sense



@SensualPudding did you ever get 48 with two grapples



Nah, I didn't. I'm sure that lil theory of mine isn't possible. It's close tho



ight i'll keep it as a footnote then



like, we could actual runs of least grapples but we could make a segmented video of it also



like this one: (just a minute)

bacardi 151 o boy



😳 😳 😳



I'm one of the only of my class that never drunk alcohol, like 90% of my friends have done it



but really, idc that much



I think the first time I got drunk was like age 16



definitely wasn't doing me too many favors though lol



well, I have no desire or reason to drink by now



That's probably good



\:D



and also, my family has a bad historic of alcoholic people



my grandpa, uncle, aunt and many cousins are alcoholic



so I might dont touch it by now ekeekek



oh yeah, that's a good call then



10/10 would gladly race wasted towny again



@merpell slowly gains consistency with nightly races and gets sub-4 in a week

I was going to beat my PB but choked at level 50 ;-; RIP



are you going for blockless 50 now?



is there an """official""" name for the 50 strat



I just say "blockless"



is it fast 50 or blockless or pixelless



neat



i just say 50 skip



but blockless works



just watched the new wr vid



we have a wallkick in wr already

congrats @rtdrtd67



nice



guys I have to ask what is this level 52 thing going on, is it something that has been made in a swf?



so we were doing races last night



and towny was drunk as all hell



and someone said "level 50 too" as in as well



and towny said "you're on level 52?"



and it was great



I sure can imagine



btw I think we can do a level 11 skip no



I've seen certain wallkicks making you go upwards



get of the edge at the start, then face left, do the magic, bon appetité



> btw I think we can do a level 11 skip no
@hetheis *now



haven't seen a upwards wallkick. How would that work?



he doesnt mean upwards



no not like vertical



but some do gain height



he means falling off



i believe the first video of the level 3 did so



hm, didn't think they gained any height. If they can it's amaazing though. thats so many more skips



I thought you got pushed by the grapple, that's always in a slightly downwards direction. Maybe bounced on 3. or maybe up, sure hope no bounce



for lvl 3 it's because he jumps instantly after the wallkick



but the speed is along the ground

ya towny jumps right after he gets the wallkick



yeah its because he jumps right after



> for lvl 3 it's because he jumps instantly after the wallkick
@rtdrtd67 aaaah okay



guess the skip will be another day



yeah, next skip



does wallkicking in level 29 save time compared to the "hole in one" strat



yeah barely



its in the segmented sheet



I think it can save like upwards of .5



saved .3 now and we just found the strat. thouhgt my 29 was good so I compare to that



if a glitchless run is still in discussion I'm 100% supportive



maybe even a socalled intented%, to keep the autoscrollers, since levels like 50 doesn't require a glitch to skip it



and 29



I think intended% would be fun. I mean I've played this game for years and I don't think ive ever played 29 as intended



oh yeah i forgot about the actual block



im down for either if you guys want



i think intended% would be fun



watch me snatch a quick WR the second the category opens



but we would need specifi rules



like whats the intended strat on 35



yeah we would need a demo run



intended% is easier with the rules as well, just a guide. all the runs will be the same



intended% is using only arcanod strats



perhaps



well



arcanod doesnt do say the block on 29



which isnt really intended



so



arcanod% when



how about we all try to make a video ourselves and our interpertation of intented routing and then compare to see differences, then see if we can find a middle ground



thats a good idea actually



right on it



give me 1 hour and my submission is done



i mean its VERY subjective as to what counts as intended or not



for example you could argue that you have to grapple the 2nd block on 3



technically that is the intended way to do it



i just personally think that something like intended would make much more sense as a category extension



or a miscellaneous main category even



i got like a 5 min run for intended



featuring 3 deaths on 39



also



i had an idea



adult swim used to have like a highscore thing



we could maybe use wayback machine to see the highscores



then reverse engineer what their times were from the score



hmmm



does wayback machine work like that



worth a try



guys i just realised level 48 is an autoscroller



yeah i got to 48 and realized i had to do it myself



i had totally fucking forgot how that level really was



oh, i didn't think of that



i found it



looks like someone reverse engineered the swf to give a score of 2.1 billion



and the 2nd place score looks suspect as well



https://web.archive.org/web/20120221112419/http://highscores.adultswim.com/highscores/index.jsp?game=3172&filter=0&itemsPerPage=50



this is the latest one available



from 2012



Everybode take your pb score and divide it with milliseconds from your pb, then we can see if we all get corelation



nah i can go into the swf and check the score calcualting formula



then just reverse it



aight



i get this number 74.6105971721



think i't more accurate just too wait for cyc too find the formula

I have no idea what to do with this information



so its (2,000,000 - saveData.time) * 10



but im nots ure what format saveData.time is in



oh btw you cant do the calculations, the lower your time is the higher your score is. it wont work like that



theoreitcally you could get a score of 0



if your saveData.time was >= 2,000,000



can't you just go to saveData.time and see what it means



thats what im doing



i mean the stuff is measured down to hundreths of a second, so i mean like isnt it just your time im 1/100 second. so 60 seconds is 60000



could be



im checking rn



4.000.000-31.800 =/= 3.980.920

alright i think i got it



thats because its only level 10



yea hetheis is right



it works differently if you have a different level



than level 50



20,000,000 - total seconds * 600



i think



i dont think so



someone give me a random 1-50 score



from a run



No I think its the same



gimme a seconds

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/733819895841685544/unknown.png



my 4:00.7 was 240.7 seconds



if you multiply 240.7 by 60



then it works in the formula



im not sure



why



its usually (50 * 40,000 - saveData.time) * 10 at level 50



but it does



btu at level 10 it would be (10 * 40,000 - saveData.time) * 10)




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/733820206962573403/unknown.png



so (40,000 - 3600) * 10



checks out



but i mean thats 1 level



why is it x60 though



am i just small brain



idk, thats just how savedata.time works



thats the way matt thorson chose to keep time



but then these adultswim scores are insane



p sure not legit



i think the first 2 are not legit



i will check tho



aight so the formula for 1-50 is (20,000,000-



yes



insane



o yea nvm



#3 looks legit



no way



it's 3:59.53



so to get time in seconds
its
((score / 10) - 2,000,000) / 60)



oh shit



wait nvm im wrong



maistlins time was a 3:59.35



could be him



- 2,000,000



thats still wrong



im dumb



nah it's seconds = (20,000,000 - score)/600



sry



its 2m



thats sounds right



not 20m



cuz its x10 at the end



these times are p insane



ok the formula is
-((s / 10) - 2,000,000) / 60



even 4th is a 4:08



i can do algebra



#50 gets 5:08.33



this might be it

({score}/10-2000000)/-60=time in seconds



(-S /  600) + 33333



there



simple



I was too lazy to add a minute converter by gives a fuck



@cyclowns can you find the formula for the hard mode 1-11 score by any chance



can someone give me some more numbers i can try the calculator on?



@merpell replace the 2,000,000 with 990,000



and itll give hardmode



i think



ah 990 kk



its levelnum * 40k for normal but levelnum * 90k for hardmode



so 990k



but it would be 1080 then



because theres 11 levels



tapewormjoe had (according to my spreadsheet and the leaderboard) a sub-4 in 2010



11 * 90k



right



or



is that not 990k



wait



fuck im stupid



that makes sense



2nd place on hard mode would be a 2:19.35



1st seems to be a 40 second run so we can say that isnt legit

i think it works



yep



it works



Pinned a message.



just maek a copy if you wanna edit it or smth



how did u do this



this dude literally did a sub-4 8 years before someone followed



nah maistlin got one right after



i think this might be the run that he was talking about



its not



leaderboard says its from 2010



the next one is a 4:08.77



and after that is a 4:19.63



whoi is maistlin?



maistlin rajere



basically tasbot



the hardmode wr holder



did sub4 in 2012



and he had a sub-4 like 8 years ago



damn



but couldnt submit because it was just the end sreen



wait



this is a sick verification tool



oh shit



true actually



yeah



it might be 1 or 2 ms off bc of rounding error



but its a good way to check



maistlin has the score in the 3:59.35



and it checks out



incredible



yeah the 2nd place score is 14 seconds



so i dont think thats legit..



god gamer



but are we gonna talk about 1st place



who is like



in the negatives



bet us noobs cant get close to his 2 billion score



the gamer timer rounds of to .92

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/733825236775993422/unknown.png



it works



rounds to .92



time to require score in the video leggo



nah jk



it wouldnt be too hard to submit a fake highscore



just edit the swf to always submit a static number when u click submit score



yeah



dude literally started his runs and went 100 hours back in time

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/733825575134953572/unknown.png



could be anything cuz it doesnt check



no wait 1000 hours



and even if it did check, you have the swf u could just remove the checks



i get that in the positives yeah



no ik



but you know



its another layer



i mean



with video proof being necessary



submitting a cheated run would be pretty fucking hard



its pretty easy to tell a cheated run



by comparing it to a legit one



theres thankfully a really easy way to check for splices i found doing the segmented run



spit it out



the fuzzy static at the end of a level will change color in 1 frame if its spliced



you can check it in the semgneted run



itll go from like green-blue static to orange static in 1 frame



bc i edited 2 clips together



btw while being on the subject of verification, should there be a limit on how my time you are allowed to spend from 10-11 and 20-21 and 30-31 and 40-41?



why?



i dont think theres a hard limit



if theres an egregious time that gets submitted where someone spends like 10 minutes in the break screen then



just reject those



> btw while being on the subject of verification, should there be a limit on how my time you are allowed to spend from 10-11 and 20-21 and 30-31 and 40-41?
@hetheis sprry not my *much



yeah like



within reason



20 seconds?



yeah thats fine



I just think it kinda clashes with the whole concept of speedrunning if you have 4 toiletbreaks during a 5 minute run



for sure



p sure my 3:55 abt 2 yrs ago had a massive break on 30



not sure what i was doing



i mean i use the time to just like split, breathe a bit, drink water



takes 20-30 secs at most



i mean it doesnt really matter all that much



as long as your entire run is recorded



i think it should only matter if its like a stupid long amount of time



and even then it shouldnt disqualify unless people submit multiple runs in a row like that



just a warning



or smth



^ exactly



so anyway



we now have confirmation of at least 2 sub-4s before rtd's run



which is sorta crazy



assuming the one on the leaderboards is legit



not necessarily



the numbe r2 on the leaderboard is straight up impossible



i mean maistlins seems legit



maistlins seems super legit but the leaderboards one might not be



but the guy with the 3:59.53 also has a cheated run on hard leaderboards



so im not so sure



hmm



maybe not then



40 seconds run



uh huh



there was at least 1 before masitlin's though



and it was either by him or by someone else



there were at least 2 sub 4 runs, maybe by 2 different ppl



since he said so ye



so who knopws



tapewormjoe also did his Hard and normal runs 1 day apart



so either he's undescribably very good at adapting and the game in general, or cheating



well rtd did get 2 sub 3:40s in one night so anything is possible my friend



true that, but I mean considering the game knowledge at the time and how the grind has been



for 1 category



let alone 2



why do we care though?



just interesting to know



It's the hall of fame



Yeah, that's what I think. but the legitamecy is just something we have to settle with the unknown. I don't thnk we should like submit or anything like that so no 'real' proof is needed



no ofcourse not



now imt rying to think if it would even be possible to cheat a run in gur



without it being obvious



like its basically impossible to splice without video artifacts



if you have music/sound on its even harder



if you have game timer on its essentially impossible



you'd need to like edit the swf to be able to get the time not being immediately suspicious



i dont think it would be possible



Nah, I don't think cheaters s our biggest concern. If we notice that something seems off we can reject it and if they're good enough they can get another run



true



if its sus just reject it and say have game timer on or keyboard inputs shown or smth



exactly



ill just reject all the sub4s so i have wr \;)



simple



no need for grinding



new rule



no sub 4s



ahahahaha



if that was the rule i'd be in 1st



with my 4:00.35



ah fuck



a good finitive solution for the problem



i thought it was the other way around



no runs anymore



well no sub4:00.5 then



the leaderboard is sealed



i should probably grind for wr again at some point



i keep forgetting that i dont have it anymore



imagine not having wr lol



all i gotta do is not die



where my non deathless club at



i wish video existed for maistlins 3:59



wtf strats did he use to below 4



without hsg or anything like that



50 skip



i guess so



it couldve been just like really good gameplay



i mean think about it



it's a lil summin called big dick energy



my 4:02.57 had 3 deaths



without ANY hsg



not even 24



i thought it had 24 hsg



huh



so its pretty realistic that he got a 3:59



no



i thought it did too



yeah i guess thats more reasonable



but i just checked



was rtds the first top 3 to have 24 hsg



or was mine i dont remember if i did it



i did not do it



so yeah its rtd's 3:55



I'm gonna be the first sub 2 though



😳



HARD that is, normal would be pretty good



glhf



sub 2 on hard would be really good



2:02 is by a tasbot



there are probably tricks maistlin never found



but then again



you are the il god



its not out of the question



He did that run flawless except for one level



only 10 levels I gotta train so less stress

man why this block gotta exist



Hello guys



What did I miss today?



> man why this block gotta exist
@Klice I hate this block too ;-;



we found the old GUR highscore leaderboard and we found out a way to reverse engineer your time from the 1-50 score



my consistency on 30-50 is way better than it was like a couple weeks ago



or seems like



im not sure why



i guess when u grind like 3 hours a day for 4-5 days u just get burnt out



then come back and you're better



yea possibly



im gonna grind 22 wallkick
and maybe the IL fast ver of 34 cause its not that hard



then go for wr probably



or a better pb at least



fast 34



actually sucks



i try to be safe and i still die



i think i may just be terrible at it



i think if i practice it a bit ill be decently consistent



it saves like .5-1sec depending on if you hit the hole in one or not so



nah i think it's more like .3-.5



i get like 2.8 with the ez strat



i get like 2.9-3.1 usually



and then 2.1-2.5 with the faster strat



yea ig it may be worth for u then



im just gonna stop doing the dumb 36 strat because its hard and saves like 0.2



yea def stop that

2 times on the same day ;-;



hey @Towny I think your magic with 50 HSG is reversed with me, I get it a lot on practice but fail a lot on runs ;-;



lost sub4 to 50 hsg hate to see it



u did?



RIP



its alright tho



im playin good



nice \:D



im playing ood too



but well



from what it seems, not enough



forgot to say it, gl merpell



where's the post in #live @merpell



who's tryna race later tn



<https://streamable.com/onigs4> p cool 1-10



6 wallkick when



> <https://streamable.com/onigs4> p cool 1-10
@rtdrtd67 soooooo lose to 26.x really smooth. nice



@merpell I just want to be as sure as possible on what is needed for a swf to be considered okay running with. As clear rules as possible. Is it like only the core game mechanics that have to be the same. Or do you have to run on the original swf? Are there more rules? Or what's the exact requirements?



As long as you either download the swf from blipz or whatever or use the no adult slim swf from src it's fine



gonna get wr with the trainer



So a swf that's changed to feature things like level editor or combined trainer mode wouldn't be viable. Makes sence, thanks



does anyone have the colored disco ball assets



ah shit i got a new pc and didn't think to back them up



but ill look around



all of them were posted in this channel so if you look through the images you should find them



i think they're all posted here so



yea

rainbow



rest shouldnt be too far of a scroll up from that



may 25th is when they were posted



all at very similar times



thats the wrong rainbow scroll down



lmao



i just had the idea of using a macro to reset



towny has one



i think



or someone else



:o



all you gotta do is have it run the swf and then click and drag to resive and click a few times for options and then new game



also that was a really fast response



getting closer

unfortunate



vod is perfectly fine rtd



the twitch highlighter was confusing me so i j downloaded and cut it



name a more iconic duo twitch and vods not working properly



Ehhhh, just thought of something. Don't know if it's interesting or not. But it WILL affect a TAS time significantly. So the time of the game is calculated by a floating number. So naturally the time will be off by a little. If you check the game code and how it checks for input you can see that the game first waits 20 frames before starting. So if you press anything during those 20 frames the game won't see it. BUT, the timer is still on. 20 frames is equivalent to 1/3 of a second on a 60 frames /s game. Somehow it only adds .3 seconds. Don't know why it misses a bit but who cares. If you put on game timer or check a record with timer on you can see this. If you end level 1 at 00:04.69 you'll begin level 2 at 00:04.99.



If you don't understand any of this. All you gotta know is that the game adds .3 secs after each level except 50 because its the last one.



49 x .3 = 14.7 seconds
So our calculation is that much off



I'm afraid that a sub 3 just got so much harder to perform



but in the trainer



does the level getting started not take that into account?



its not like you can move instantly there



No, it doesn't. Because in the trainer the time resets after each level complete or death



If it would take it into account a 24 sec 1-10 would be possible sence we know a 27 is possible



I don't know how it works actually. This confuses me 😄



I guess maybe you're right. I think it somehow does take this into account. Because otherwise the times would be way off



Oh, it should take it into account sence it's the begging of the level. So instead you start each level at .3 seconds



False alarm everybody😄
Just got a bit confused



If anything it's yet another splicing checker. Because it's nothing someone would think about when they splice, that there's always a bit you can't control



The grind has begun. Won't submit untill I get a deathless sub 4 or a sub 3.50
Wish me good luck cuz this can take the whole day



gl dude



ya best of luck



Imagine only needing a day to get sub 3:50 😐



I did it, feels good with 1 minute improvment on PB

JESUS CHRIST



no crazy tricks, just 0 deaths that got me there, lucky



Damnn that’s insane



Congrats



thanks, somehow I have the hardest time with 22, killed so many rounds. Won't try and beat this in a while



maybe if I'm bored



can't verify it until this evening but im sure it's fine, grats



Im back from goochland what did I miss? :v)



Oh nice pb @SensualPudding



thanks



now i gotta beat towny to get the bronze disco ffs



honestly the silver disco looks the best



oh holy shit it didn't even register that puddings pb is second place. gg, welcome to the big kids table



nah pudding's ILs already gave him a seat



truueeeee



But soon my IL's will disapear. Have never suceeded with a wallkick. So this is backup



You own 50 though



calling it now, 50 will never be beat



Unless we figure TAS out



We're all out of a job if TAS comes to fruition lol



a TAS will be sooo fun with the wallkick meta



literally wallkicking off every perceivable wall



yeah, you can wallkick ceilings right?
Things will go fast af



Yeah, you can wallkick ceilings but it's a little harder



btw if anyone wants to try wallkicking off the ceiling in 21, you can probably save some time. but it's tight



but with a TAS we don't care about that, only takes more time



yeah, with TAS anything is possible



yeah, thought about that 21 wallkick before but were unsure so didnt write it was possible



I'll write it in then



YOU CAN WALLKICK CEILINGS??



i thinnk when hetheis originally found it he wallkicked off the 45 ceiling at the start



oh yeah



~~clearly inaccurate name~~



~~i propose hyperspeed bonking~~



I like wallkick, easy to understand what it is



yeah im memeing



I love how you use slash text for sarcasm



feels more natural than /s or whatever



ya im all for it



/s is a little cringe



a little dated



when i read slashed through text i read it like theyre muttering to themself



like they know what theyre saying is dumb



but its funny to them



so they mutter it



you know



thats kinda what it is actually lmao



oh for fucks sake are you guys actually doing the hardmode segment



>you guys



yeah I aint touchin that shit



just sensual



lol



yup, I needed a break before so i tried it out for a little bit



how beatable is the wr



it looks clean with no deaths and most of the levels are auto scrollers



not to, I mean some levels could be done a tad faster (7), but the rest is like TAS



yeah its beatable by like 3 seconds without wallkicks or shit lol



yeah hardmode wr turned me off completely from even trying. Cause it looked way too good



Any opportunities for HSG?



doubt it



maybe in 8



8 is the worst level in existance. Hate that freaking level



ya i didn't beat 8 until a month ago



lava wallkicks are a thing too?

yup



honestly i doubt it saves time in 34 lol



can u wallkick on the section above the lava



but that complicates the theory of wall ejection



or is it too high up



I mean on the walk section



could just wallkick in



looks like you'd just faceplant into lava yeah



and yeah sensual but youre already moving at like the same speed as a wallkick



from the grapple



setting up the wallkick probably just wastes time



ahhh, that's true. maybe it doesn't save much



hmm



actually maybe



lemme give this a couple of attempts



o yea it's too slow



man i can't even go for attempts



nice pb tho



i haven't been in not-2nd-or-1st since my like 4:30 time



better get back quick then so you don't start to like the 3rd spot to much



ah fuck it i'll try and make some time to grind the next couple days



i miss my gold disco ball



if i can actually beat it



im building a new computer in a wk or two so i can probably stream a lot better



oh nice



idk who changed the frametime calcs on the spreadsheet but i had them at 30 fps because i was using them to verify the length of the clips for the segmented run



which is 30fps

nah, I need to get consistent with this shit



even if I'm  baad a t this



I'll only do 50 blockless when I have a decent PB



that 49 was hype sensual



Yeah, were so happy with 49



that 49 looked like it probably tied the IL wr



Wow, I tied 2 IL records then. Both 49 and 11. That's 1/25th. 3.07 soon

probably doesn't save time though, but one less grapple if that category was added

20 takes 1 grapple anyway

omegalul (3) 


use the moving block 4head



oh fuck, that's true. I accompilshed nothing with this



lmao



its cool though



So guys, I've been theorizing that since lava wallkicks are possible, there is no doubt in my mind that elevator skip on 45 is definitely possible with TAS



holy shit it is



almost impossible for humans tho



how would you get height



> how would you get height
@cyclowns Use wallkicks to get distance from the wall, then grapple to climb up, and repeat before you hit the wall



exactly



@Doggo any improvements on least grapples?



It may be hard getting around corners, but if I had TAS powers, I think I could figure something out



this TAS dude is very good, he has WR in every game he plays lol



top 10 oldest jokes



haHAA



i think that one was found scrawled next to cave paintings



kekkekekekekekek



for 45 hsg can get u a grapple on the last horizontal lava bar

{Reactions}
👍 


true



but i don't see a way to reach the moving block from there



So idk if you guys have ever spam grappled against a wall in the air, but sometimes you get a slight vertical boost. Idk the timing, but with TAS I could figure it out, and that might possibly bring about a new frame perfect trick



hmm maybe



But without TAS who knows



I don't think elevator skip will be RTA possible



even without wallkicks



even if its RTA possible its not RTA viable because it'd be slow

criticize



There's some truth to that



when you have progresives like myself say its shit at forigh policy and has huge gun problems, it sound like i hate the country. BUT I belive lots of good can come from it like the reform of Japan or bolivia



Also hating america is the new 🆒  so idk anymore



or how we have some amazing schooling but it is so heavily dependent on money



pr:omegalul: gressives



making huge imbalances



One thing that I don't like about america is that u guys pay high taxes and have almost zero public services



like schools, hospitals and etc



Yeah, we have 0 schools and hospitals. Sad



well, schools are paid by local aryas



I'm talking about public schools and hospitals



and hospitals are private orgonizations



my rich arya has fucking fantastic public school



go literaly 20 miles in any direction and they are garbage



its a huge problem



yeah



we pay taxes on the dumbest shit

LETS GOOOOOO



Imagine not living in the 4th rainiest State in the US



imagine living in the us



imagine



sorry to interrupt this imagining but i j did this air wallkick and i def didn't jump



and i still got height



around 15 seconds



<https://clips.twitch.tv/YawningStupidStingrayEagleEye>



not that one



kek



o i shoulda j cut the clip



i think maybe if you still hv positive y speed from jump



you can get height from air wallkick



its cuz you hit the thing



and sorta bounced off it



ive done thatb efore



You don't bounce in GUR



You can bounce off a block without jumping?



its what it looks like



tho



I've had this happen too, it's definitely a jump



It does look like he bounces there



But I didn’t think you could just bounce



p sure u can't bounce



I wish you could bounce for 1



You can't bounce



you definitely jumped



looks exactly like my 23

check the inputs tho



maybe holding up buffers a jump on that



or smth



oh shit, yeah i forgot you have inputs on



lemme analyze this



he doesnt press jump separately or anything



monkaHmm



yea i was holdin up whole time



no x



This could be important



we should save this clip under unsolved mysteries



And you're 100% sure you didn't jump? Your recording software could have skipped a frame of your input display



no



i was trying to not jump on purpose



to test



This is huge



HUGE



idk what for



but it's huge



Very big if you will



You know the half an A press meme? This could be hitting GUR pretty soon



Are there any other recorded wallkicks that happened as the robot was rising from a jump



The maintaining momentum from a jump theory seems likely



I didn't think of that, while that may be a possibility, I think 22 starts with upwards speed



<https://clips.twitch.tv/AmazonianEnergeticEchidnaDAESuppy> pretty terrible quality but u can see the robot doesn't hit the ground



that one makes sense



but on 23 you can clearly see him hit the ground i think



yea i might've hit ground



Well... Adding bounce to the fucking iceberg



i'm just trying to show that not bouncing is a possibility



cause it's clearly possible to get height from fuckin air apparently



if you get a wallkick at the start of a jump upwards



taht should give you max momentum up right



so is 36 wallkick possible



If a wallkick can preserve vertical momentum... Maybe. The timing would have to work out right that the arc of your jump could last the horizontal distance



<https://clips.twitch.tv/ProductiveCharmingYakPunchTrees> prob not a perfect wallkick and also didn't start holding right immediately



even so looks p unlikely



👀



How feasible is savestates in the training mod



not very i dnt think



Did custom levels work out I never saw anything after they were first discussed



Bc I’m thinking about a custom level that’s just a copy of the end of 50



For the hyper practice



Idk it’s not terribly hard to get to the end of 50 to practice it and ofc it’s good practice to get there



yeah they work



But it would make practicing just the hyper easier



Cool



i could totally just make an hsg practice map

WHAT



interesting



Just a small sneak peak. Need a bit of time. Can't figure out the wallkicks yet



is it replaying inputs



or something



Yup. Have had it in mind for a while. That's why there's a input saver on the GUR Trainer. But it was hard getting it just right. The past one had a lot of missing shit and couldn't read it. Just got into it again yesterday and think maybe I did it

Would've been perfect if you guys didn't discover wallkick. It can't do that I think



I need input here. What do you guys think about the whole TAS idea. Should I not release it or it should be open for everyone?
With a TAS fake runs will be much easier to make.

Or should I just like do some precautions to show its a TAS during a TAS run, like inactivate the scoring and write TAS or something



Faking runs will be super easy if all it does is running premade input



I mean, I trust pretty much everyone here, but you're right to be cautious. I know nothing about TAS programs, but if the program is integrated into an SWF itself, couldn't you code a watermark of sorts?



If that's possible, few people have knowledge of editing SWF files, so it would narrow the possibility of someone cheating



Oh I just realized thats what you were saying with inactivating the scoring and writing TAS. Yeah, I like that idea



Yeah, exactly. I think I'll do that for now. And if anyone wants a full game run that doesn't look TAS or like that. Like a segmented run we have now. Then you can just send the inputs to me and I'll can do one without all that stuff



As long as you trust me not to cheat😉



btw guys is this intended% still a serious thing we'll do



why is doing 30 with all three shurikens hard as fuck



also does 33 even have an "intended" route



@LycroP2 im pretty sure 44 is possible in one grapple



by just doing the intended route



:widebot:



yeah



wayyyyy easier than 44 skip with two grapples



but at the same time i think i fucked up putting 45 as two grapples



seems VERY hard to do it in two



so the category doesnt suck anymore but the grapple # stays stagnant



until someone proves 45 is possible in 2

does anyone else here play with particles



too lazy to turn them off every run



bro these hard ils are gonna drive me insane



thats hard mode for you

I could send u the macro file I made if you download jitbit

lol alright



i highly recommend a macro @Doggo

@Doggo the IL wr uses 2 grapples, or am I wrong?



one to grapple the first block one to grapple the second block one to grapple the ceiling



ooooh ,okok

it still is slow cuz I missed HSG 2 times



but at least I did the pillar section \:D



> slick
@demonthe1 thx \:D



how do u guys call the extra speed that you gain if release the grapple shortly after increasing it size?



idk if I explained well, but I'm not talking about HSG



i dont know of a name for it



but it is a thing



u know what im talking, nice



we could call it hmmmmm



grappleboost



idk



idk, Extra Release Speed or ERS



> grappleboost
@cyclowns I think its a little blank



what do u think about ERS?



idk



not very snappy



cuz it aint hyper fast like HSG, so I called extra



let's see @everyone suggestions



> not very snappy
@cyclowns hmmmmmm



ers lol, f1 fan?



no, if it's something from f1 its just a coincidence lol

since its extracted from the files i think the font name is just 'Default'

the sad part is that the letters are all black, not psychedelic like the in-game letters ;-;

Damn thats crazy bro



Do you Think it could be done on 23 aswell?



Though I think it's an amazing trick that could be useful for us I'm afraid you're one week late. I think the wallkick is both faster and more consistent when you get used to it



yeah i doubt this saves time on 23 or 32 compared to wallkick



could save time on 5



looks sick regardless



could it save time on 49



it feels like it might already be used there



Kinda looks similar to sensual’s hardmode lvl tas



yeah it does



but yeah @Davi Duarte on 23 and 32 specifically we found another glitch that is a little bit faster called a wallkick

basically if you hold up while against a wall, press grapple and jump for a very short duration, then hold the opposite direction you go flying



i just realized we really need a new guide or something to chronicle all of this stuff so people dont have to read random forum posts, guess whats happening from the WR video or join the discord to understand tricks



Glad to know the trick is new! But that wall kick is even sickier! =O
I will try to reproduce it and see if I can find new places to apply it, thanks for the feedback! 🙂



Is there a way to TAS this game?



we've looked but there isn't any tas emulator for .swf



as far as we know



the best we could get is a segmented run which we're working on



Sad, I also looked, didn't find either.



cyclowns saying the wallkick was in 23 and 32 specifically is kinda misleading though



we've found timesaves with it in like ten? levels



but most of them are super miniscule



32 and the start of 22 are the only ones people are attempting in runs



Yeah @Davi Duarte to assist in your glitch-huntin check out the IL spreadsheet in the pins



Shows which levels use wallkick/hsg



oh wtf i didnt even see the new 21



> could it save time on 49
@cyclowns  cant we wallkick level 49 too?



uh



no?



if you think you can wallkick from start to end you are *highly* overestimating the distance wallkicks get you



also if theres no floor on the wallkick doesnt it just send you down or what



or like diagonally down



eg 22



diagonally down but more to the side than down i think



well



still



but the momentum only lasts so long if youre just falling



Didn't see the segmented spreadsheet in the pins, so I'm pinning it here!

We should improve this discord a bit with bots, proper roles and categories instead of random text channels



yeah i was thinking that



rn everyone just kinda has admin perms



Alright who wants to be new owner lmao



whats the current bid



i can try and organize it



I can attempt to make some kind of a discord bot with speedrun.com API or something. never done it before though



i think i could do that pretty easily



i dont have any kind of hosting for bots though

ahh, we'll then you can do that

Could just leave it open on the computer all the time, not perfect but better than nothing till later



yeah i'll just have it run in the bg or something



what would the bot need to do even



i guess maybe display top 10 runs



and get someones run from their username



yeah, notify when new runs been submited. Ask new mambers for usernames so we know who everyone are and so on



im down to be an admin or whatever if you guys need me



I'm down for that as well
Think merpell is a good coice for the 'admid' otherwise sence he seems to do a good job at the speedrun.com admin stuff



alright i'm lookin through server settings



what are webhooks?



bots and so on, a lot of things you can add



stuff for twitch notifications



and git notification



and such



so u could have auto-twitch notifiations actually



ah i see



also merpell u created a role named "new role" lmao



yeah i fucked up



it let me create it



but not edit it in any way



or delete it



gonna see if i can make a super rudimentary bot really fast



how many admins r we havin and who should they be?



or maybe some kind of vote



I think we should have 1 "head" admin



i dont think it matters too much



just volunteer i guess



the API wrapper i'm using for python for the speedrun.com API honestly just feels like it's making things harder to use



and i would be better off just doing http requests myself



~~wr holder gets owner, if its beat the owner has to pass ownership or else we all leave and make a new server with them as owner~~



Speedrun.com has an official API otherwise



5head



i know its a wrapper for their official api



its just that its really annoying to use because its not really well documented or finished



it wraps everything in classes when it could just give me the raw json and make things easier for both of us



don't use that wrapper then. I think the raw json exist under the API on the website



yea i found a way to make that work



much better



finished a super basic form of the bot



ill work on it later



right now it can just return info about runs

no it isnt



looks like it doesnt see whatever run it is



pb is verified



seems to not like it



it waits a bit before checking



ah ok

nice



i mean i could techically do oldest



it wouldnt be hard



just.. not much point



yeah it would just be static tho lol



i could have it go back any # of runs tho



i wonder what it is actually



ahh it would be btspiders actually nvm



when i do an API call it says that zachsk's is



because it was done in 2013 and just verified in 2015



it goes by verification date?



i think



maybe it doesnt count people that dont haev an accoutn



wait



which of zachs runs does it say is oldest



cuz hes got 2



oh nevermind



now it says its arcanods



if you go by verify-date



if you go by submitted date its this one

bot is dead rn



kk



ill find some way to run it in the bg later



then it can be on like 80% of the time



should we have a bot text channel



then maybe you can have a pinned message with a list of commands



sure



and so we dont spam notifications with general



i could make it ping i guess



since run verifications are pretty infrequent



what do you mean this game is active af /s



ok i tried to do organization but i cant move #general or #guides to the general category so w/e



someone else do that

:5head:



:rainbow:



:bronzeball:



:silverball:



:goldball:



is there a way to make certain emotes exclusive?



like



if rtd is 1st at the leaderboards



only him could use the :rainbowball:  emote



and etc



no



oh



wow, i've noticed that the server looks more organized now



very cool \:D



what do you guys think? tell me if its bad resolution, so I resize

which one do you guys prefer? (if you liked any of them)



I chose the very strong green because its the predominant collor



in case anyone is wondering this goes at the personalized speedrun.com logo at the top left \:D



i like both



I like it, its a huge improvment



but we have to choose one ;-;
> i like both
@cyclowns



probably the lower case one



thanks both of you \:D



idk tho



wait, ill make reaction as a vote option



vote in which u prefer



oops, sorry



oh, I did in aseprite, recommend it!



I need to get aseprite at some point



i just downloaded it at steam unlocked kekekekek



oh wait



I think it cant be green



because when you dont have an account



the top bar is green



damn it



strong pink or white?



lemme see



i think white will work



pretty good



I'm doing both so you guys choose it



the pink one

yeah i think white is best



well, being honest I think that too



could inspect element to see how it looks on the page



or...



well



I dont know how to do this



so could you do it please cyclowns?



if its too small and loses quality, warn me please

should look something like that

on light mode it'll look about the same but on a green bg



hey @merpell can u put in there for real?



yep just a sec



yahoo



tell me if its small so I resize it



yeah its a bit small



maybe like a 50% increase would be good

doesnt seem to make a difference for some reason huh



wut



in discord it shows it bigger right?



lemme try something



yeah its bigger



just a min



the default speedrun.com logo is 640x78



i assume thats our problem



because ours is like 340x90



oh



will try to entend it so



extend*



and now?

i mean like the text still has to be extended to be near the border



think it's the ratio



thats what i did now



^^^



the ratio



okok



so its gotta be smooshed a bit i think



621/162 > 640/78



I'll try everything i can lol

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/738089949668311080/bigger.png

hold on let me try something



okok



i mean



ITS THICC



on the site



lol



yeah



:widebot:



ekekekekekeekeke]



well



why dont we just stretch it vertically so?



cuz then its still the wrong ratio



if the changes on aseprite arent working



oh



how come for example the sm64 logo looks way taller



and now?

it's the exact ratio u said



nono



thats the one i was using as an example



the one we need is 640x78



or some variation of that



eg 320x39



but this one is 640x78



oh wait it isnt



it shows up as 345x90 for me lol



I'VE BEEN BAMBOOZLED



nt



What sizes they accept?



the minimum and max



whatever you want



im not sure theres a min and max



for example the sm64 one is only 180 pixels wide



well, i think this should solve it

🙏 


nope



\:P



wut



but



its bigger in every platform i tested



did u pick the right one?

try both please



nope



as in



neither are better



both are small?



okok



yes



ah wait



got it to work



YAHOOOO



what did you do?



in paint 3d just changed the canvas dimensions to fit to the text



and it was pretty close to the ratio



so it works way better



actually i think i can make this look sick



i have an idea



> why dont we just stretch it vertically so?
@LycroP2 i meant to say to use the paint here, buit if u discovered by yourself, wonderful!



tell us your idea :D



i just wanna see if itll work first



it looks nice at the site



> @LycroP2 i meant to say to use the paint here, buit if u discovered by yourself, wonderful!
@LycroP2 I should've said diagonal here



I'm going to lunch, good luck in what u are trying to do merpell



but, before, lemme guess



are u trying to do an animated version?



with all the collors and etc?



i doubt thats possible



and maybe its moving



are u trying to so?



thats cool



If the site accepts gifs as logos



It's totally possible



Does it accept gifs?



im not sure



But even if they accept, it would be VERY hard to do it like in the game



And I don't think it accepts because I've never seen one that's a gif



holy shit @SensualPudding



3:35 my god



congrats



thank you, sub 3:30 goal



@rtdrtd67 are you going to let sensual do it first?



kekekekeke



Who doesn't love competition



o shit



If he grinded it out he would get there first, I mean WR with 3 deaths



But I'll probably try hard to get it now to try and get there



gl to yall



That was close to WR



gg



Yeah, a slow 50. Didn't want to risk it. regreting not risking a little harder actually



Had the chance to snatch it



yea definitely wr pace on 50



i mean i've been playing almost every day



just killin all the wr paces to 41-50 as usual



those 10 last levels are so scary when you have a good time



yea



especially 48 recently has rly been rough



Could always spend an extra second on 48 to make it a bit more consistent



yea



but my pride never lets me



and then i lose 10s



But in the end your pride get you these crazy wr with deaths. All those tricks can save time once in a while



I never even do 43 trick, I'm really a coward



yea for sub 3:30 u'll def need to add a couple strats



prob can't save 6 seconds on that run just by cleaning up movement



The numbers of runs completed with more strats goes down to like a 10th. But I'll try and add a few because otherwise that time save will be hard



or if your just going for wr



no need to go for 2x if you don't want to :widebot: 🙃



hmmmm, we'll see

You'll probably just not subit new WR if theyre not sub 3:30 just to make me not grind as hard

the pressure...
I'll do my best
Good luck in getting it



> intentional sandbagging inc
i was under the impression that sandbagging implied intent



otherwise its just being bad

I used these tutorials for the strats I have now. He explains every room in depth, so much depth that you’re prolly best off putting the video on 1.5x speed and skipping around a bit.



But he explains stuff well and usually also shows some slower but easier/safer strats alongside the fast strats.



1 hour is p good for just trying to go fast with no strats in mind



Also I think your city is already like 3 seconds faster than my pb lol in runs I usually get like 1:16

F



> Also we said this in vc but i think u were away, u should j put a number next to our names to show wins
@rtdrtd67 good idea. Also next time I'm thinking about doing a scoring system where first place is 5 points, seconds place is 3 points, third is 1 point, last is 0. Or something like that. Kinda like mario kart. Then we add them up at the end. Would give everyone incentive to keep going after RTD inevitably finishes before us



O yea i was thinkin that too



Gotta make my 2nd and 3rd olaces count



Give up robot: Grand prix



The races r so quick we could do a ton in a row tbh



True. Maybe that's how we should do the tourney lol. In big groups like that



I still haven't decided how I'm doing the bracket



but I'm thinking that or double elimination



O like a group qual stage —> winner’s and loser’s



Kinda like smash summit if u’ve seen that



double elim is meta bro

man i dont have the time to be actually good at this game



You'll derust, man. I believe in you



my only consolation is that i did hit 43 skip like 15 times in a row when i was practicing



but actual runs were ass



anyone who knows why youtube can't process my video. It stops at like 95%, 99%, or says it couldn't be processed. It's approximately 1 hour 15 minutes long and is a .avi file. I'm really exited about this video and I want to show it to you guys, but yt wont let me. Any solutions?



I’ve had youtube pause for a couple mins on 95% processing before



Then again i only upload mp4 and way shorter so i’m not sure



because i use a free version of videopad i can't export my editing to mp4 files, do you know any places I can do it?



Not sure what videopad is but I use an editor called lightworks that allows mp4 export



videopad is also an editor



Or maybe there’s some online avi—>mp4 converter



There's always Converters online for everything



Just do a quick search



hey @merpell congrats on the shit colored disco ball aquisition \:D



i'm having almost zero time to play, I want a decent PB, but i guess I'll have to wait ;-;



Lol so the same software company that owns videopad wont let me make the original video as a .mp4 file for free. But they literally have a free software that converts your .avi file to .mp4



gg



holy shit guys the file went from being 2 GB på 800 MB



yeah avi is a shit format



wise words



MP4 gang



my next PB will be an MP3 /;)



OBS can output directly to mp4 and so can premiere so



only issue with that is that premiere is hard to pirate



yeah i get an mp4 from obs, but my editing software limits my options and converts it to avi



rip



does windows have an in-build editing software (kinda like on iphone camera rolls) where you dont use an external thing



not on win10



i dont think



:/



theres free video editors that are okay



kdenlive is fine



my only issue with it is that renders take a long time



no there's a trimmer in the win10 video player



that's all I use



oh is there



if you wanna do actual edits then ur fucked



but if you just wanna trim your video then it's pretty solid



you can also do it with vlc



i did it a couple times but it wasnt super reliable because idk i was probably doing it wrong



so i just use premiere



> but if you just wanna trim your video then it's pretty solid
@merpell how do you acces it?



just right click your MP4 and open with and there should be 'videos' or something like that



and there should be something in the bottom right that looks like a pencil



oohhhhhhh I've found the issue



my account isnt verified



im limited to 15 minute videos

is there any input lag or its almost the same?



I'm thinking about buying a new mouse, but idk if its better to invest o a wireless one



is it too heavy?



depends from mouse to mouse but most from brands like Logitech, razer etc. have little to no input lag



my friend plays fps games at a top level and uses a wireless mouse and says there's no input lag



certainly nothing you might notice



hmmmmm thats nice to hear



i asked him bc i was curious why you'd use something wireless playing an fps



as for weight it varies greatly



but what about the weight?



there are some really light wireless mice but there are also really heavy ones



idk you could just compare the weight of whatever wireless mouse you want to the weight of your current mouse



^



you could prolly find a light one



nice idea



I think I'll go with a logitech one, the most awarded as I hear



but I'll search it better



thanks for the help \:D



g305 is a good bet



lemme see it



man, I found and I'm using my dad's old bluetooth mouse, its very bad cuz its that standand microsoft ones, but its feels almost the same as input lag



and the best part, I play at a very small table so my mouse cable keeps hitting the wall



and with the bluetooth this is over



hehe boey



note that lots of wireless mice (most of Logitech's, if not all of them) use a usb dongle instead of Bluetooth because bluetooth's delay is massive



if it's a good wireless mouse its not noticeable



only matters in like..idk super high end fps stuff



and even then



the one i'm using rn has this dongle



Even with this mediocre mouse I'm not feeling any lag



technology is getting crazy



yeah that's what im saying



like if you use anything from a decent brand that's newish you'll be fine



everything that ain't this will be VERY fine

it's so strange not having the 2 side buttons



tbh i never even use the side buttons for web browsing



just like push to talk



man, when you get used to doing it



it feels so good



recommend you forcing you to use this buttons



in like 2 hours of doing this



you'll start doing it without noticing it



WTF rtd, I haven't noticed that you got some amazing times recently

damn boe



hey @merpell I've looked at the G305 and damn boe it looks worth it, at my price range I have almost no doubt its one of the best



there's only two things that I'm unsure of



if his scroll wheel is good, and his grip



I'll search more about he weel, but the grip I have no clue how to know if its good



thanks for the recommendation! \:D

9 was clean



yeah



3 and 4 were both p good



and 1 obv



@Towny so we racing this week?



Yeah probably



@rtdrtd67 seriously? How do you do that man? Congrats on the sub 27 /:D



thanks



what do the golden times mean on the IL sheet?



considering they're all by rtd i would assume those have particles



makes sense

no lol the golden times are just new ones



just to notify cyclowns that the record has changed for those lvls



and if he decides to edit them in then they become normal colored again



ooooohhh



that is more reasonable

oh good to know



also i shaved off .15 tonight with improvements to 49 and 12



off the segmented run, that is



how close are we to 2:XX



5.72 seconds off



I think TAS could get the sub 3 for sure



yeah



im imagining some crazy wallkick shit on 50



in tas



The whole run would look like RTD's 43



yeah



49???



hello???



Yeah idk I guess jumping a little first helps



friggin unbelievable



That's the last level I thought were improvable



i mean 11



Obviously, but those 2



i figured 49 could probably happen before 2 10 and 11



then again 10 got saved anyway



.01



oh hey someone finally beat my 44



11 is a meme, there is no possible way to improve it



I'll put a bounty up



200 bucks to whoever can improve level 11



and I'll buttchug a bottle of jack live on stream



Put that bounty out on r/speedrun. bound to get some attention and no one will do it. If they do, well you payed 200 for a newly discovered glitch



200 bucks and the firstborn child of everyone in this server



Sure fine, I'll buttchug your children as well

hey @Towny how is your macro programmed on GUR?



to restart



it



How is it? It's great. Takes less than a second to reset



wow



which keys it presses?



I can show you how to set it up if you want



im going to program it on my mouse



plz ;u;



show me pls



so the programs called JitBit Macro Recorder. Download that, and I'll send you the file



so i cant do it on my mouse :(



you could



my new mouse has a macro function i thought i could put the key presses in it



here i can put the key presses

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/742531556274470952/unknown.png



you can it would just take more effort



oh, well idk how your mouse macro works, but yeah you can program it to to click File>1(the most recent file)>New Game



@LycroP2 with lgs you can bind your mouse buttons to a key instead of doing the presses in the app



that way you can still use jitbit or something else



well



I think ill end up doing what you guys are talking



but



i did something



a little dumber and worse



but it was by my own thinking



so its less lame



What I did was bind Crtl+O and Ctrl+V which  has this: C:\Users\Pedro Licinio Souza\Downloads\GiveUpRobotNoAdultSwim_tkgcj\GiveUpRobotNoAdultSwim.swf



thats the file



like, I still have to press start and all, but its a start at least



o yea that's what I do



i'm basically a master of pressing ctrl+OV at this point



congrats!



hey @Towny can you send me jitibt link pls?



the link to the program, or the program file I made?



the one is, as I would say *paidless* hehe



ahhhh



i see what you mean my friend



give me a second



hehe boey

downloaded virus lel



Lol



What is the RNDD?



Should I extract it?



I have no idea to be honest, I probably shouldn't have sent that link, cause I've never downloaded it



Honestly no kap on a stack I paid for jitbit



Idk if I do extract or not



Yknow, jitbit comes with a trial period I think



The problem is that with the inflation, in my country, 40U$$ is like 150US$



It has a keymaker inside of it



I never used keymakers or keygens



Is it safe?



Keymaker.exe

What key did you use to enlarge the screen like that?



Full screen?



ohhhh i see what you did



I sped up the macro



There's an option in the settings



I put on the fastest



Not the one that says "not recommended", I picked the one in the scroller



I think the placement is messed up



I'll fix it tomorrow



I think it's more optimal if I start the macro at full screen HMMMMM

yo @rtdrtd67 what does the gold highlighting mean on the segmented doc?



new runs since the last draft



Is it automatic, or should I manually highlight it if I improve one?



i manually did those



*sweats* how are you people so good at this



virginity and autism my friend



ah yes



destro, you on the leaderboard? What's your PB



idk :p



i dont play that much



like i do speedrun the game but not seriously :/



gotta get on that grind boi 💪



eh



¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯



fair enough



if i did record it then i would be like



27th i think



but i dont have any evidence so



yeah



That's not bad at all



yeah but no evidence ;-;



If you ever wanna record, try OBS. It's the best screen recorder, and it's free



right



nice move in telling him to use OBS straight away



i lost so much time with bad screen recorders ;-;



if someone told me this earlier



remember the good ol days of fraps?



Or hypercam 3?



we've come a long way



lol how long has this speedrunning thing been going on?



For this game, or speedrunning in general?



For this game, I'm assuming since it's release in 2010. I remember the submit score button hosted high scores on adult swims website, which are calculated by time



speedrunning in general probably dates back to the first atari games that calculated times. Like dragster



and todd rogers cheating ass lel



lol



does he still have records or



did he just get banned outright



I'm pretty sure since he was outed no one is ever going to trust him lol.



idek if hes still alive



shit he was old in the 80's



wait nevermind just looked it up he was in his 20's WOOPS

using a different strat



damn



oh shit



2 tenths now



yall are gonna love this one



i fuckiong refuse to believe that thats faster



i hate you

it's .3 seconds, actually



very tight angle, but still might be improvable



dude, that's hella nice



:widebot:



dammn, prob not worth rta



no not at all. super inconsistent



It always pains me to beat one of doggos times on the IL



soon he'll be one of the 0 squad



no one is part of the 0 squad



since everyone has 11 wr



TRUUEEEEE :LELW:



that's what i tell myself so i can fall asleep at night



if we get a proper leaderboard set up on speedrun.com, would there just be multiple first places?



I'd assume so yes



> soon he'll be one of the 0 squad
nah 34 is unimprovable dw



bet



bet



don't challange him, Towny is a master at improving unimprovible levels



id like to see him try



sounds like a challenge to me



oo well i just did 34 without waking the block



not faster, but definitely going on the swag% category



o also 45



45 is def improvable



@Doggo i was givin that a couple tries but i couldn't even get the 45 HSG once



do u have a setup



uh not really? it wasnt painfully inconsistent in the first place though



yea that's why i thought it may be rta-worthy



i j can't get it for some reason



weird



idk if its good for rta



saves like a second at most during whats already one of the most stressful levels



same could be said for 50 hsg i guess



but that saves way more



practicin this sucks lmlao



yeah the 10s waiting time every time



not even like you can zone out for it either



we could get cyclowns to make a custom level thats just 45 but only the last part



he made long 24 right



savestates when?



m i just had the dumbest possible idea for a potential skip in 42



but i doubt it works



shoot



if you jump at the peak of the moving block's height you can get decently far offscreen



enough so that i think if it were the exact frame of the peak you could maybe be entirely offscreen for one frame



and the lava wall over the ending is only one block wide



so if you  wallkicked off of the lava wall to the left  and jumped at the exact peak of the moving block ??? maybe



relies on a lot of dumb shit coming together and even if its possible i doubt anyone will ever get it even practicing



I think even going offscreen, the bottom half of your hitbox would still activate it



once we have TAS it might be worth looking at



yeah the hitboxes might not suck as much as i think they do



but id imagine a full jump would cover an exact amount of blocks



bro im getting 43 HSG consistently



lets go



PB inc



43 hsg is by far the easiest one



imo



i think 43 is the hardest, 46 easiest



yall sleeping on 24



now that i got the setup down it feels that way



idk



24 hates me



i get 43 like 85% of the time and 46 probably 50% of the time



24 is easy tho ur right



24 is easiest



50 is barely harder



46 is harder by a fair amount and 43 is impossible



I thought 43 was impossible, but i got the setup going, im getting it more than half the time



Soooooo, I were sorting my files today and saw an unfinished project. I don't have to much time rn to finnish it but i did something real quick to get it working. It's a TAS for you guys that you should like. It's far from perfect, just works. Don't even know if it can handle wallkicks. but you can download and try if you want. be my beta testers and have some fun



https://file.io/PielU54sqPqH



it were 16mb so to big to upload here



wow, never worked with TASes before, it looks very hard to mess with



not to hard, can usually just play a good level and then optimize the gameplay



I mean to get things perfect obviously is really hard



nice 404



oh, doesn't it work?



is it august fools already



same for me



well fuq



added it to speedrun.com instead for now



ive just noticd that the cap in the general voice channel is 69 hehe



well played



hey @Towny tied your level 4 IL this shit is precise af



this brings my number of tied ILs to 3, but 0 wrs ;-;



hey guys, since I dont think there's much improvement on less grapples *%* what do you guys think about less jumps?



do you think it would be cool?



freak you @Towny its the 4th time already ;-;

off handedly



wow @Doggo  is fast af boey



congrats



this would be a more competitive category than less grapples since is simpler



just a misc ya know



wait



how did u do level 16 in 2 jumps?



oh nvm



i get it



u got it?



k



yeah



u drop the block and then grapple on the upper one



clearing one jump



noice



anyone down to race tomorrow night?



yep

anyone else think the moon doesnt exist?



people believe in the moon?

thats absurd



is the moon just an USA  giant drone that is seeing our entire lives?

what made me more angry is that i messed it up at lvl 45 but I continued since if I did 47 and 48 first try my timesave would be massive, and I DID pass 47 and 48 first try

lolololol



impossibly hard



lul



My favorite is looking at old comments on like arcanod or mastalins vids like "HOW DID YOU RUN ACROSS THE SPINNERS??? THIS GUY IS CHEATING!"



ohhhhh



thats true



lol u walked on the spinner ur a cheater xd



all the non-wallkick levels are p decent though



> My favorite is looking at old comments on like arcanod or mastalins vids like "HOW DID YOU RUN ACROSS THE SPINNERS??? THIS GUY IS CHEATING!"
@Towny have  u seen any super mario bros runs comments?



the pirana plants hitboxes are pretty broken



so you basically enter the pirana without dying



YEP lol



I used to speedrun sm1 in high school



if u go to the recent comments they're like: this dude is using god mode, he should've died like 3 times



Shit was crazy back then, nobody could handle it haha



> I used to speedrun sm1 in high school
@Towny I see you're a man of culture as well



even in the recent runs there are comments like that



Oh boy, when will people learn



People would go NUTS over Ocarina of Time speedruns, cause that whole thing was a mess of wrong warps and RBA dupes



LUL



its like Dream's cursed minecraft videos



the recent comments are pure gold



every speedrun or challenge run is like that



like 'wtf this guy is god'



i got a spinner comment on my 4:02



and i was like "dude just try it"



old school



show the new 22 strat to people confused that you can walk on spinners



WTF HOW DID YOU GO THROUGH THE SPINNERS HAX



show them a wallkick



"lol speedhack get banned kid"



"I did 7:35 but I didn't used hacks, unlike you kid"



idea for a run



give up robot 2x speed



with cheat engine



wow



that would be AWESOME



how about the GUR Level maker? is it possible?



ive been working a lil bit on it



just havent had much time lately



hence why segmented run isnt getting much work either

hardest part is rendering the level and being able to select stuff and what not



the level files are rly easy to parse



Anyone else down to race? We're gonna start soon



GUR TAS would be sick



@SensualPudding has TASed like 2 or 3 levels



its pretty hard to do though



got a 9.88 lvl 50 lets gooooo



Sub 10,nice. Congrats mate



noice



nicee



hey guys, which game do you think is the WORST to speedrun?



by his replay options, menu and etc



like, think in celeste options and menu for speedrunning and turn upside down



think in the worst game that you know of to speedrun



desert bus



isnt it that 8 hour long trip?



a game with a lot of RNG also enter in this category



like, imagine speedrunning mario party lol



or a game with a lot of longass unskipabble cutscenes



combine all 3 to make the worst speedgame imaginable



exactly



thats what I'm looking for



>10 hours long, every aspect of the game is RNG based, and half of it is cutscenes



and have an awful menu



to be shit to restart it



imagine if the hardest part it was the literal last input of the game lol



I'M LOOKING AT YOU 50 HSG



Out of the ones I know, off the top of my head, I would say Star Fox 64. Pretty much the whole run is buffering you boosts, lag reduction, and taking lines. Boring as fuck



yeah sf64 sucks to speedrun



its on the boring area, but can you think in a annoying one?



i remember watching my friend speedrun pokemon snap



how does it work?



and the whole run was him looking into the sky to reduce lag and make the game go faster

{Reactions}
omegalul 


and occasioanlly catching a pokemon



lmao what a shame



i have no idea why he speedran that game



maybe cuz doesnt require any training, so he must have little time to play



That's the silliest thing I've ever heard



oh



you remembered me of a braindead speedrun



theres this game



You cant do simple maths under pressure



its a very cool game



woah



i found out about that earlier today



weird



where you have limited time to answer simple math questions



> weird
@cyclowns lol sick



the normal category for it is very cool



since require very fast thinking



but theres an exploit where if you just hold one of the answer keys



the game plays itself light speed fast



hold the key%



you just have to be lucky



i like to call it braindead%



holy shit ur right



i just hold P and Q and the game plays itself



lmao



> i found out about that earlier today
@cyclowns where did u find it?

both are WR btw



imagine playing that category



wait



actually



you could literally make a bot that speedruns it for you



yeah lol



or



just put something heavy on your P key



I'm thinking on speedrun the normal category



its less of a game speedrun and more of a mental math competition



it sounds fun tho



exactly



its very fun



i did a run of it



just to see



i got 58 seconds



can improve a lot



i wasnt recording but ill do it later



lmao

hold the key% guide lol



hey, I thought in a cool mod for GUR, if its possible to modify it, my idea is a mod that keeps the speed that you are to the next level, so for example, on level 41,  you leave the level super fast, but your speed keeps to level 42



it would lead to some very cool strats



and a very fast pace



how much time do you think this would save from the normal game?



non-stop category lol. Probably wouldn't save too much seeing as how this game has like 0 momentum



non-stop, nice name, some games have this category, i just couldnt remember the name



would save some seconds in some levels



like level 4 to level 5



the speeds u leave level 4 would make level 5 faster and the speed you leave level 3 would do the same



and if it this category is possible to be made i think it would need to spawn you at the same height you left the previous level



or not? what do you think?



im getting closer to the 27.xx \:D

Good job m8!

holy shit I hate lvl 16



for me the last jump has always a 20% chance of failing



a fcking bad timing one



does anybody has a strat to not fail the last jump?



jump later than you think you should



it does that because when it looks like you land youre still at the peak of your jump



barely above the ground



ºOº



i'll try it hehe



Have you tried holding down the jump button? :LELW:



o fck didn't think of that

@Towny the good ol' times



@Towny whats your 3x3 pb



Tonight it's 47.95, but I just started derusting today. My real PB is from 2016. I'll try to find it, but it's somewhere in the low 30's I think?



What's yours?



The only evidence of a pb I can find is my old r/cubers flair that says "sub-40" so definitely in the 30's



I need a new cube rn though, mine keeps locking up



mine is 14.7 but it was extremely lucky, an easy cross, an f2l pair ready to be inserted, and a pll skip



i averaged about 22 when i was into it



havent done it in several months



Damn you kids got fast fingers. Merpell said he has a 6 second 3x3

Pog



That’s v pog



Can it do wallkicks?



most poggers my friend



I don't know, Can't do wallkicks myself so couldn't test it



Can try it and see



How long were u holding z for?



1 or 2 frames?



I've never tried it so I don't know. the easiest way for you to try it is jumping straight into a level and try it. it will save your inputs. then you can replay it and see



Z for which level or whaaa?



Alright yea i’ll give it a try soon should be fun to experiment



yea, even if it can't do wallkicks I've managed to beat 1 and 50 at least



:monkaS: .exe



yup, an installer. so now it is a game in your library, not a file just used on another program



sence they will remove flash player and all



for the txt file does each line represent one frame?



Exactly



And have to start on frame row 19 i think



TAS information is in the read me file



ya i read that



how come at the start i'm getting a >> input



or i guess in general sometimes it's < or > but sometimes it's << or >>



perfect

Another thing, I don't know if the timing on this TAS is exact. I have another which is but had some trubble here. think it is. but for safety don't publish these times. send the input to me and I can varify them



yeah, I don't know why it creates double sometimes, but I think it's exactly the same. just a visual bug



@rtdrtd67 did wallkicks work?



yea they work



just press Z for two frames



That's great, can you send me a input file of it in action please



turns out pressing Z for one frame is what gives you that limp wall hit and your robot just falls down



ahhhh, okay



fuck that was fast



Well got a 2.23 lvl 43 in no time. Think we can scrap most of the IL times we have



tas and segmented are not the same thing tho



True it isn't



Sensual this is great!



I'm working up a TAS as we speak



I love how you can edit and save the file, then pretty much immediately play it with T



Thank you
Pretty proud



Though I recommend you go in and change the time to like one second when you edit it. Otherwise it'll save a lower time when you get it and have to change file all the time



well guys, I can now assure, the triple wallkick strat on 22 is indeed slower than than we gave it credit for

holy shit i just had the best idea



uh oh



Made a quick copy of the Segmented run sheet for TAS so we get some more insight and so on. No video requirement or anything like that, just trust. Because I'm curious



yoo



@SensualPudding Does the TAS feature automatically pick the lowest time file to execute? If so, an easy way I've found is naming the file "TAS Level #_0.00.00" and that seems to always get executed



Yeah it does. that's a good idea to always name it that while editing



Then when you feel done it shouldv'e made a file for you with the correct time



YOOO I JUST IMPROVED LEVEL 34 BITCHES



YOU ALL SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE



wasnt there a bounty



BUT TAS CAME IN THE CLUTCH



does it only apply to segmented



now improve 11



didnt towny put up the fkn bounty anyways KEKW



🤔



I put up a bounty for 11 haha



ah



I said I would butt chug jack or something



we could also bounty 2



Should we set up a seperate spreadsheet for TAS level submissions?



i think 2 is



literally the only level that hasnt been improved since the fastest times forum post



I beat 2...



didnt sensual just set up a spreadsheet



its another page on the il spreadsheet @Towny



what when



or say he was



yeah, I set up a quick TAS thing



oh sweet



I'll submit my 34 time



how does the tas work



havent downloaded it yet but im interested



also i forgot 11



i figured it would be harder to do all in the swf



@cyclowns You type out the inputs on a .txt then execute it in the game with "T"



7.42 GOOD FUCKING LORD



wheres the video for 50? I wanna see that shit lol



you could probably get slowdown for a TAS using cheat engine



honestly



as for savestates idk thats more complicated



but text input works



don't have any TAS vids. thought we'll beat them so much no anyways. have the fies



its probably easier to just share the TAS files



is there anything set up to make TAS perform a full-game run and not just IL



because that wouldnt be too hard i dont think



^ good idea



but im also gonna submit vidja



I have shit for that, don't you worry



you could just have it auto start the tas on each level and speed through the 10 level transition stuff



nice



ladies and gents i present: better 34

Probably still improvable tbh



did you do a wallkick off the top of the end



or smth



yeah i wallkicked the frame I hit the ground



im interested in better 50 and 43



those gotta be interesting



actually had an idea for an swf modification



display game time at the top of the screen so its easier to read



that way if we recorded a full TAS run then we wouldn't have to edit in timecode manually



good idea
I'll keep that in mind for when we have a full run



also i am still working on the segmented run i just have very little time since school started

r/TAS - Is it possible to TAS a flashgame?
5 votes and 8 comments so far on Reddit



"It specifically requires 3 things. Linux, libTAS, and Gnash.

libTAS is a framework for doing TAS's on many games in linux. It also works on emulators run in linux.

Gnash is the GNU implementation of flash. And allows you to run flash movies and games on linux.

It seems to work for many flash games, but apparently it can be an effort to properly setup, and can depend on the exact game."



i didnt realize libTAS worked for flash



or that there was a foss implementation of flash



Yeah I've seen it. but i didn't get it to work. I don't really know linux so I gave up and created this instead. works for now. Just the savestates



linux :omegalul:



im a linux dweeb so i can try and get something working

oh god oh fuck



😳😳😳👐



Please don't shoot me Mr yellow beam



Wait



How the fuck did you beat lvl 2?



with our hands?



😳😳😳



I beat that when I played normally once, but didn't record but ave the input file so i put that as a TAS to avoid confusion

How much time?



.02



1.98?



Damn boe



yes



That's good shit



flash TAS with libtas looks annoying asf because you need to install an sdl version of gnash and it apparently doesnt even work on arch



gnash is like 15 years old



wow guys, did you know the vertical HSG window is like 5 or 6 frames



fr?



i assumed it wasnt frame perfect with how consistent 24 is



but i didnt think it was *that* lenient



Hard to tell cause im working off a moving platform for 45



but it's definitely like 6 frames here



I'll test on 24



~~test on 43~~



It might also be different depending on how long your grapple is



in 45 would it be faster to hsg at the start and ride the top of the first moving block



if you grapple a wall its probably *possible* to ascend to the second block without using the first again tbf



PARTICLES OFF BY DEFAULT LETS GOOOOO



believe it or not. excep for TAS times, that has taken the longest fucking time to fix. but wouldn't let rtd play on this without that



LMAO



a small price to pay for rtds bullshit



my bullshit too tbf



20 still has particles



and i cannot replicate it for my fucking life



20 is probably possible sub 4 with tas tho



that's the fucking problem
He's the best god darn player here is by a landslide and he never turns them off



yeah



Results are in, you have a 6 frame window for vertical HSG

swag% level 3



this is confirming my suspicions of 20 literally just being rng



i changed a single frame and didnt get a boost at all



also lmfao



yeah nah i was gonna tas 20 but ive come a conclusion



all my homies hate 20



the game is really unreliable so it's hard to tas something perfectly, esspecially something like 20 when you have to change directions and shit



im talking specifically about the grapple from the lava to the left wall



sometimes you just get



a giant fucking vertical boost



when you do it



and it saves like half a second



damn



god damn i just tied my 9



This is pretty interesting

ez strat will do in runs



hahahaha holy shit dude



That beggining looks real easy



that last wallkick was the sickest thing I've seen



how in the world was that only a 1 second time save over RTA lol



1 second is a pretty sweet timesave though



the first wallkick is prob like .3



looks like basically no timesave



so sick that it wont let me run it for some reason



i literally did a shit 45 and copy pasted the inputs but shift t just doesnt  do anything??



did u save it



yes



lmao then i'm out of ideas



its not shift T



oh it works now



just T



RTD???



WHAT IN GODS NAME



🙂



ok ive gotten 2.32 on 9 both with and without a wallkick



wallkick one seems improvable though



yoooooo

level 21 pog



WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK



these wallkicks are dope



wtf, that's fucking amazing



the frame perfect spinner strat needs a name



didn't even knkow u could go off the spinner like that



yeah it's been done before, it's frame perfect



oh was that the alternate 32



dunno, but sensual did it when he first showed off the first TAS attempt



god damn lava wallkicks are annoying to tas



theyre all limp dick



i was giving the theoretical 42 some tries



they shouldn't be hard



if you're wallkicking in the air while descending, it's always limp dick



wait what



i got a good one



once



its just like  ridiculously precise on lava



shoot



i don't think the 42 thing is possible



i dont either but its worth a shot



*bro how do you even wallkick*



its rly hard



hug a wall holding up



im still not good at it



and press z for exactly two frames



oh rip



i remember when I was first learning HSG



sounds hard :p



and i thought it was frame perfect or soem shit



but wallkicks now



i can got like



a few pixels the other way 0-0



and thas it :p



im probs doing it wrong :/



i just hold up against a wall
and then press Z and X really fast



then hold the other directio



and hope that i pressed it for the right time



Yeah you need to be against a wall and holding up



I'm second on the lederboard and I've NEVER done one RTA



im trying to get like top 20 :p



wallkicks suck



just drop them tbh



right now im only 27th so thas my goal :p



still waiting for "43 wallkick if run sucks"



LMLAo



i dont want to do wallkicks rta



22 23 and 32 are the only ones that save anything



I'm done trying to do wallkicks rta



I'll try 32 if the run is aids, but that's about it



shits stupid

FYI guys, discord puts an extra underscore on uploaded files, so it wont work until you remove the underscore between "level" and "9"



oh that makes way more sense



Noice!



I love how the wallkick looks like a gentle little tap



yeah 20th on the learderboard looks like normal strats 0-0



so ill probs try to get that lol :p



plus i have some wiggle room cus the guy dies twice



destro you could totally get 20th with basic strats



good luck buddy



thxx



the inputs for the wallkick are so dumb

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/750068662299394118/unknown.png



but getting it properly when youre descending in the air is like subpixel shit



oh dang



removing one of the spaces makes it limp dick



those inputs :/



removing the left presses during the 2 frames of grapple kills you for some reason??



what level?



9



the fact that i got the *exact* same time without a wallkick makes me just want to optimize that instead



but fucking around with wallkicks overwrote my no wallkick 2.32



It might be better to wait until you hit the ground



then you can get insane horizontal speed



doubt that would be faster than standard 9



worth a try



yea



yeah i was gonna say, swinging through might be the faster way



yeah waiting to hit the ground is .05 slower



than either of the other things i'm trying



2.32 is good enough for now idrc



yeah, it looked pretty nice ,the beggining swing looks optimized



aw rip messed up my run



beginning swing is basically all of the time i cut off of my rta 2.37 yeah



also glad we have proof that when you jump off of the 10 block does not  fucking matter



rip 4:53.08



hmmmmm, think I got something wrong in one of my beta 3.0 testes

how do I update adobe air?



DAMN BOE



you guys are really excited with the TAS



and I like it



that's pretty epic



I want to see the new trainer but idk how to update adobe air ;-;



Shouldn't the download install it for you?



idk



i click the program



the trainer



and it says preparing to download



and then 1 seconds after it says



an update is necessary



of adobe air



but have no direction



I'm downloading it again



form the adobe site



hope it works



oh wow



my adobe air version is the 3.4



they're at 32.0 O-o



I'm just a *little* bit off



done



DAMN CENTERED SCREEN



DAMN BOE



is it acceptable for full runs?



No it isn't. Don't think so at least



what do you mean acceptable?



like



idk the best word to describe it



just a min



like



if I do a run on it



can it be verified for the leaderboards?



n



why?



just want people to use one standardized swf



or a web version of it



so we can know theres not fuckery



oh, yeah, you're right



Could be some time bugs or you could use TAS or whatever. And it's much easier to set rules when they're strickt like that



it's sad, but it's right

woly



lvl 4head



congrats ma boe



Im gonna fill in the blanks for the TAS spreadsheet with the segmented times, just so we can get a time total



I wanna see how much time we've saved so far



do you think that a TAS sub2 is possible?



sub 2? No



no?



im pretty certain a 2:50 is pushing it



it could go down to like 2:30 in like ten years



oooh, okok, I have no insigth yet on how much is the TAS saving yet



2:4x seems pretty likely honestly



but it would take  a while



made this one by hand

just optimized last grapple



level 11 optimization when?



kekekekeke



towny already has one he just can't reveal it without having to take the bet



EKEKEKEKEKEKEKE



idk if the "your name here" thing is gonna work for tasing



like i basically just took rtds work and edited some stuff so that it was .05 faster



id feel guilty removing his name from 24 entirely



put both



Put both



yeah i can just change it to "authors"



base gameplay: rtd Optimization and TASing: Doggo



and anyone who edits the tas is put there



if someone makes a completely different tas and its faster they can reap benefits



hmmm



anyway thats .1 down



.13 to go



whats the most inhuman TASed level until now?



I think 21 looks pretty radical



yeah, 3 wk and one of them is at the ceilling



two wallkicks and both of them are at the ceiling



2?



ohhh



yeah



dumb me

yoooo



noiceee



it has happened



I'm going to be doing some selfisolation streams. In the near future I'll have a lot of time on my hands, so my goal is a new PB and get a sub 4:20



nice, looking forward to it



I don't think it's possible to get around the last pillar in 45
I mean how would you even do it, you can't do vertical wallkicks and you can't reach the last block be swinging under the last pillar

Anyone got an idea or should it be deemed improbible to ever do



Unless a new trick is discovered, I'm guessing elevator skip will forever be a meme



~~lava hsg~~



:LEL:



also can we count the shuriken 1-frame as a glitch



yeah



21 was the only one thats used it so far right



imn pretty sure it also saves time in like hard 4



yup



ive used it on another



which



25?



yeah 25



shuriken 1-frame into ceiling wall-kick



name a better duo



21 is probably the most epic looking tas level



not a frame goes by where you're doing something normal



21 was dumb as fuck



no u



do you need a certain grapple length for the 1-frame spinner



for example would it be possible at end of 22



or do u have to hold in a certain direction



NOpe, any work
But the direction you get launched in is weird and defferent



ya lol



on 22 it just launched me up-left



not into the goal



the one david showed off in 32 launched up right but strong up bias didnt it



oh nope it was right bias actually



he just kinda rode the wall for a while



@Davi Duarte there's a way to tas this game now btw

nice impovement



whats going on with the spinners on your 22 tas @rtdrtd67? Are you grappling the one on the left



yea



for some reason when i tried to 1-frame the one on the right



it sent me left



so i tried it for the one on the left and it sent me right



which i don't get but it worked out ig



geanious



If it aint broke dont fix it



i mean it kinda is



but if the broke helps then roll with it

unless you can do it off of the moving block



which



lol



oh that's really sad, close though



if it worked from here im pretty sure the setup makes it slower anyway



maybe wallkick on 2nd block



im trying that yea



also i created a tas channel



oh fair enough



but yknow we can j stick everything in general as usual



you know, you might be able to swing up high enough to wallkick off the moving block



seems tight, maybe not even worth it if you could



the time loss is much more concerning than the possibility



if you grappled the top left of the block then its Probably possible



also improved 9 by .02 with the strat w/o wallkick

Hey guys, I'm writing up some explanations of the glitches for the TAS video, what are we calling the spinner 1-frame trick?



Insta-spin?



something simple?



wdym



The glitch where you grab the spinner for 2 frames, and it flings you up



i havent done any of the tas stuff yet so im probably a bit ootl



see level 21 TAS



ill look



i have a vid on the segmented sheet linked to it



oh thats funky



I was thinking ISG (instant spin glitch) to be a cheeky cunt and reference OOT but idk



kekekekekekekekek



ISG, ERS and HSG



noice



ers?



Extra Release Speed



call it DZN



ers?



again with the f1 terms man



KKEEKEKEKEKEKEKE



idk this term



extra release speed? Is that a trick?



> call it DZN
@cyclowns whats the meaning?



deez nuts



GOT EEEEE



> deez nuts
@cyclowns DAMN BOE



F



also extra release speed is like



when you press down and then immediately release a grapple



and get extra speed



u got me real hard on this one



> and get extra speed
@cyclowns exactly



I was unaware this was a trick



I mean, I knew holding down while releasing give you horizontal momentum



but i didn't know it was established



sorta established



sorta



i think ERS is a good name, but if u guys have any better names on mind



oh so you just made it up right now



reeeeeally established guys lol



but yeah I guess ers is good



a good name



i think he made i up a while ago



at least i remember it



davi called it instahook



thats not a bad name



how about inverted hyperspeed grapple hook spinner glitch?

> reeeeeally established guys lol
@Towny no, i thought about a while ago



nothing stablished, but idc



@Towny i thought there was no cap on downward speed, for example doing a ceiling wk?



no there is a cap on downward speed if you aren't grappled



ye



Try it out with the spinner on 49. Release when you're on the left. You'll see you wont go any faster than your terminal velocity



ceiling wallkicks can only push you left or right



well, perhaps at a downward angle, but never faster than your free fall



ah rly



i guess it was placebo but i always thought wallkicks made you descend faster as well



at least falling and ceiling wks



Pretty sure it's just an illusion cause you're moving so fast



anytime you're going faster than robot's normal running speed, falling will always be less than a 45 degree angle



Well fellas... I burnt my thumb on a firework last night. Probably can't play til it heals

either that or switch to keyboard

Big thanks to everyone who helped out, seriously



this was really fun



And hopefully this will get the game some more attention



Pinned a message.



Now we just gonna watch this video on repeat till summoning salt is forced to do a vid on it

do views actually go up when you do that



YEP



Don't they have that you have to view like a few seconds for it to go up



I don't think so, but who knows



only one way to find out



lololol



If only you could like a video twice



Wait I have like 3 accounts lol



Time to boost this shit



can't you watch it in many tabs



I can't imagine what that would sound like



ive done this on discord for a discord alt but you can add +literallyanything to a gmail and it counts as a separate email for an account but sends confirmation emails to the same email account if that makes sense



so myemail@gmail.com myemail+alt@gmail.com can be used for 2 different accounts



Yeah my music account and gaming accounts are set up on the same email



did you plug the discord



Yup, in the description



the whole tas together is fuckin crazy



good shit



clean as shit. Smooth as butter



Couldn't have done it without ya cyclowns. Good shit boys



i still want to finish the segmented run video at some point lmao



just dont have time for shit



and a lil burnt out on this game



Fair



but ya the segmented run would be cool to see



segmented run was still fantastic



kinda discovered a lot of shit through it



yeah, I love the competition aspect of it too. It pushes us to discover new things



i just watched it for the first time and i didnt realize how many wallkicks were actually possible



49 was funny too just showing off



i wish there was more swag on like 39 and 42



but the swag on 49 makes up for it



as well as 25 and 29



21 was really cool too



Shit I forgot to throw in my swag level 11. Where I grappled morse code



LMAO



I think I typed "GET FUCKED ROBOT"



video is ruined



I was gonna code in morse for the bounty I made, but you can only fit so much



:LGBallT:



Guys did you try wallkicking on the last falling pillar on level 46? In the TAS



Just talked about it in the #tas



could be a timesave, have to try a bit



Oh damn



where did you go on all this, I thought you'd be interested in making TASes and playing around, you were a real tester before that did a bunch and found some nice stuff



Yeah I know I know, I just really haven’t had any time on my hands. Would really have been interested in helping with this



hey people i have been here for some months but havent really participated y have lately done some runs i am proud of and would like to know hot to record runs in order to publish them i just wanna know what prgramm do you normally use if you use something in particular



also i wanna know if i **need** to use live split or how to prove my time in a run



nah



i don't use livesplit just record (i use obs) and submit ingame time



you do not need to use livesplit



as long as the video shows the full run and you can see the time at the end then its legit



i use OBS to record as does pretty much everyone



^ what these guys said



thnks



thanks



Yeah what cyclowns said. We all use obs i think



ill need to learn how to use it and then i will start uploading some runs



good luck



it is a pretty easy program to use so it shouldn't be bad



ok ill check it out



cant tell if it actually has that many views or someone is actually mashing refresh

does that do the wk



yes



nice



noice



the tas is fairly new, small new timesaves will prolly keep getting found for a little while



yeah especially if i keep watching the current one on repeat 24/7



not even for the purpose of finding timesaves just because its so fucking clean



i think 21 is my favorite to watch, the robot just goes boing boing boing



22 and 21 are close



flying through the level



29 😌



some others are more impressive bc the levels are harder but 21 has nice visual appeal



every level that has a cool strat rta has a wayyy cooler strat in the tas



1 22 29 43 50



also the 45 wk i have sucks ass



i think by now we know my TAS wks r rly unoptimal



29 is easily the coolest



29 is coo



50 is 50



anyone play hollow knight



game is a banger



i am playing hollow knight



is really good



but sometimes i just dont know what to do



whenever i got lost for more than 10 minutes i would just look up what to do



i did it twice



like the map usually tells you where you havent explored but once youve gone to all those areas and youre still stuck its boring just roaming around forever



So today I had university examination, but all i could think about were that god forbidden TAS
So I just finished a 3h examination in 10 minutes for this game



lol



so... how did you do? A+?



We'll have too see, I'll come back when I have the results
Easily A though 😄

welcome



:cheesed2meetu: uhm, cheesed to meet you



did you add that just for this



yes



:cheesed:



also i think i might have come to a revelation



all three of the glitches we have rn are the exact same fucking thing



yeah basically



Yeah they pretty much rely on the same principle



grapple change momentum in a frame and you let go to store it



yea it didnt click until i thought about why instahook worked fsr



it's all letting go on a certain frame window to preserve momentum



yeah letting go when the game is trying to correct your position



i have to guess that instahook is just the game snapping robot into the center of his grapple



so that the circle around the spinner works properly



oooo wow



that sounds like a good interp



now that im thinking about it theres a *chance* that i can save a frame on every level that has a halted wk



if the explanation for wks is what i think it is



how?



wks shouldnt rely on being exactly 2 frames, it should just be that the frame you release is the frame that retracting the grapple snaps robot away from the wall



Oh shit, you're actually right



Yeah i've done that before



Idk why I never thought of that, but you can just grapple the wall and wait to press up



ok im testing and holding grapple for an extra frame does still give you a wk



but its still limp dick if you had downward momentum



there must be something with releasing grapple that fully cancels your vertical momentum



Yeah, and I think the momentum you get is reliant on how close the grapple is to robots face. And if you're falling, it probably ends up a bit above you?



oh that would make sense



also i lied apparently



i get a wallkick if the grapple is 4 frames instead of 2



non limp?



realistically you can hold the wall for as long as you want



still limp



but i think theres an upper bound



on how long you can hold it



is there? I've held it for a few seconds RTA and still gotten it before



14 frames on the wall theres no wk



huh



it might be because of oscillations of the grapple animation?



maybe im wrong



11 frames still has a wk



but it's worse than 10 frames



wait that might just be because the swf doesnt hold right for as long



yeah thats more reasonable



but yeah everything up to 11 frames has a wallkick of some sort



except 1 obviously



it's kind of weird that 1 doesn't work actually



you'd think it's because robot doesn't get the extra frame where they're snapped away from the wall, but you wk by having up pressed *after* the grapple



Yeah trying to wallkick with 1 frame doesn't even push him away from the wall. Guess the game doesn't try to calculate grapple retraction until the frame after it makes contact. Explains why instahook is second frame too



oh true trying to instahook frame 1 makes the noise but your momentum literally just doesnt even change



can you use that for swag strats



possibly



in like 30



like grapple spinners that you dont need to grapple for 1 frame



lmao



i think that would kill your momentum actually



swag strats in the shortest level though



gotta believe



The IHook explanation sounds interesting. But if that's the case it would technically be possible to fly any angle you want to, depending on which way it have to correct you



i just wanna say that I love all phrases that @Doggoputs on his statuses



Joined the server.



Posting this on TASVideos forums was a good choice.



And hi.



hello and welcome



(here from TASVideos)



Nice to know that we cought someone's attention with this little TAS project



So I was curious about the code behind it. I assume ActionScript bytecode (or perhaps ActionScript compiled into ActionScript bytecode)?



So here's the deal, I'm not really a programmer, but I have for the last few months tried to learn as3 and so on as a hobby to try and do this TAS program. So don't know all the lingo, just so you know.
Yeah, so it's as3, the hardest part was to decompile it all from a swf file for me, but i managed to make it work. then it were just editing the as3 code i wanted to edit and so forth
I can give you the scorce code of an older version if you want to. maybe not the bes written code but it does it's purpose.



Sure, yeah, I'd definitely be interested in seeing that.

Also, I'm no Flash guru myself, honestly. I've just modded a few Flash games in some minor ways, but it it something I want to learn more about.

I would guess you used JPEXS FFDEC and added code using that?



Also, I don't know if this came up, but libTAS might be an option for getting the TAS published on TASVideos. Ah yeah, I see cyclowns found a description on the TASVideos site about libTAS.



oh yea uh



@Administrator you might want to get rid of the mod perms that everybody has



in case that video blows up and the disc gets raided



you can give a `trusted` role to like me, klice, davi, lycro and hetheis that has emote perms and stuff



I don't want to do anything with mod perms... but if I did, it seems like this would have been better to say in private.



fair



good idea Doggo, we should do that
I'm not home this weekand but hope one of the other mods can look into it



give the tas author role admin perms if you can do that, i'm the only non-admin with it and i can fix it fine



if you cant then towny should hopefully be up soon though



Well, I can't do that because rtd is the only one with admin permissions

But I gave them the ability to modify server things so you should be able to



alright yeah done



i realized you gave me perms before you told me that you did btw, im not the flash or anything



What?
When did I say that?

I mean it's tru, I'm not the flash😅



that is not at all what i meant



yeah i did look into libtas for flash



i could probably get it working but my main issue with it is that everyone else would also have to go through the grueling steps



so i wanted to see if i could get it working through docker somehow



also yeah all the edits made currently have just been using FFdec to modify AS3/flash bytecode which can be annoying as expected



but if you work mostly through modifying shit in code caves then its usually fine




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/754377405128376430/unknown.png



sometimes you get fun bugs like this



haunted swf was funny



Well, I actually haven't been using FFdec in months...



sometimes when you were about to die on stuff like a spinner the fps would tank to basically 0



i still want to use a debugger and step through WTF it was actually doing and why my code changed anything



@SensualPudding what have you been using



Well I used it to decompile the program. Then I copied the code, line for line because the copy is horrible. And copied all the files and fixed some of those init(init(init(. And stuff like that. Also gave proper variable names

The I take all that and can edit in in Adobe air or a flash project program or something like it



hmm
i tried to do that but i couldn't get it to work in adobe flash



that would certainly make things easier though



i didnt think the AS3 decompilation was robust enough for it to be like directly importable as a flash project



Well I had to change some things. Took a while while to get a good source code

You can always chack the hash code with cheat engines and translate bits to information



I have the code though so you don't have to do it. Can send you it if you want it



sure



might make things easier on myself for the level editor



I'm away this weekend but I'll send you later

You want the raw game right?



i never figured out how to even get it imported into adobe software but i guess if i did it would just be a matter of fixing random errors 1 by 1



yeah



Hey, congratz everyone for the TAS, it was very fun to watch



I'm a bit confused with the input format



it says that every line is a frame, but in the input files you often have multiple times the same key on the same frame (e.g. `>>`). How does it work?



So, double inputs like ">>" mean robot is in contact with the ground when it happened. This actually wasn't by design, it just kind of occurred by accident, and we figured out that's what it meant.



But it's functionality is the same. ">" and ">>" will do the exact same thing



okay!



Yeah, the TAS has some kinks to it lol



I assume you have a custom version of the game to run it? Is the SWF (or whatever format it's in) for that in this server?



Yeah lemme track it down



I should pin it

> So, double inputs like ">>" mean robot is in contact with the ground when it happened. This actually wasn't by design, it just kind of occurred by accident, and we figured out that's what it meant.
@Towny
>> occurs when the robot is in touch with and surface even if it's by means of the grapple. So if you grapple and hold forward and down it'll look like >+Z, but the frame the grapple hit the obstacles it will be registered as >+>Z



So not only when he walks. It's a neat little mistake that often help. Don't know why that's the case but it is



So wait, it's not known why this is the case?



Nope, it just happened lol



No it's not. I have not debugged it really. Thought it was a good thing so haven't figured it out



yeah its weird that it would register 2 of the same inputs in 1 frame

I was off for some days

Wooow, the swedes are taking over

It's not my alt, or is it



He sure loves his jumps, jumps at the beginning of every level. That's so much potential time save if he didn't



And BTW for all non swedes
He's name on yt is "Benny the big dick"



classic



Big dick benny :pogu:



You swedes are top-tier memers



Sorry, I have another question about the game:



Did you mod the game (for TAS) to have a full 60-fps framerate?



No worries ask all you want
Yes, the game runs at 60fps. But it runs at 60fps even unmodified



yeah ok, because my flash projector has a 30-fps cap with hardware acceleration



and does not reach 60 fps without (although it is an rather old 64-bit Linux one I think)



Oh. Well the TASed game runs at 60 at least. And thought the base did to.
Do you only reach 30 on the unmodified or the other as well?



the base game runs at 30



for me



Does the modded run at 30 too cyclowns?



no idea



i mean if it ran at 30 you wouldn't be able to save 0.01



That's what I thought
The imput files sais it's 60fps

So if the base game runs at 30 we're cheating a bit



I'm on an old bad laptop right now and get 44 fps, so it's above 30fps

w/ wallkicks



This gives me an idea, ya'll ever played HORSE? Like with basketball



we could do something similar in GUR



GUR bingo



Ay thats a good idea too



hard to come up with bingo reqs for a game this linear



id have to imagine itd mostly be either not doing skips or doing very hard skips



could also be levels that are hard to do in min jumps or grapples/waste a lot of time if you do them min jumps or grapples



like 1 jumpless, 42 jumpless, 39 in 3 grapples



Damn that's a good idea



anyone wanna play among us? we got a spot that needs filled

:cheesed:



uhm, cheesed to meet you



me too how do you do



Joined the server.



welcome²



tryina figure out how the hell you tas a flash game



Well the TAS of GUR is kinda not accepted as a real tas
Reprogrammed the game. Otherwise if you want it legitimate I think LibTAS could be looked into

Contact Cyclowns and maybe he can help
Otherwise I'll help if you wanna reprogramm the game as I did in GUR



hmm how would you reprogram the game



it seems like the best choice



tried hourglass before and the game just refuses to load in flash player



What's the game?



was gonna try gur because i've got no other idea atm



It's kinda tricky to do hourglass or LibTAS. I don't really know it



Ahhh, well if you go into the resources page on our speedrun.com page there's a download with instructions



hm alright



It's named GUR Trainer



yeah got confused cause no description mentioned tas but lemme check it out



how would you do this with other flash games



Well personally I'd probably decompile them and reprogram them like I did here. Just because I don't understand the emulators



yeah it'll take me long to know what's causing hourglass to completely screw up the game loading



yeah tasing pc games is very annoying



idk how youd do it without just editing the gamr like pudding did



main problem is the loading



flash player works completely fine when running outside of hourglass



i'll see if i can figure it out

Hello



I’ve been getting into speed running recently and saw the amazing 3:30 time



And then joined here



Pretty epic



yeah rtd is pretty sick



I have a question tho



whats up



How on earth did the walk kicks happen



I have never seen anybody do that before



We just noticed that spamming the grapple on a wall will sometimes push you back, and figured out it's a frame perfect trick that can give you a shit ton of speed



It’s really cool



Trying to figure it out rn



Yeah it saves tons of time on the TAS



By watching the vid in slow mo



I’m not really good at speed running but I’m trying



It's not a trick we usually use for real runs, but it's possible. If you can get semi-consistent at them like rtd, you can save some good time



Just make sure you're holding up, then try to time your grapple to two frames



I've pulled them off in runs, but I don't really go for them unless the run is dead otherwise



What does that mean when you say “to two frames”



press z and release two frames later



Wallkicks require you to press the grapple for two frames



it happens cus when you contract the grapple there's a limit on how close you can get to the wall



and if you're already closer to the wall than that, pressing up snaps you to the limit of how far you can contract it



Wow that’s a lot more complicated than I expected



its easier to understand than hsg imo



Or instahook lmao



nah instahooks the easiest



But we still don't know what causes the angles with instahook



i cant see it being anything other than the theory i gave that one time



and said theory is easier to understand than wk (not by a lot i guess but still)



if you grab the spinner at its top it launches you down and the direction youre going in, if you grab the spinner at its bottom it launches you up with variable direction but always heavy bias for up



I still think wallkicks are easier
I mean it's the same principle but with a spinner you have to account for spinning directions and you can be offset all directions instead of just left and right



the direction the spinner goes has nothing to do w the ihook angles



but the last point is fair



Oh, maybe it doesn't



yeah the 8 ihook goes counterclockwise when the hook usually goes clockwise



but in 21 they both go clockwise



I would think that if a spinner went counterclockwise and you'd be shot upwards you'd be shot like at 15 or 30° to the right. And the other way if it's clockwise.



But that could be movement from the character as well as just inconsistencies



Yeah, sounds stupid when I say it. One frame of change from that spin wouldn't change shiz



im p sure you dont even spin until frame 3



frame 1 the game checks if youve grabbed it, frame 2 it resets your momentum and corrects your grapple to be in the middle of the spinner



Sounds reasonable



No but if you gpab it for 1 frame your movement resets...



does it?



ye



couldve sworn i checked at one point



Pretty sure it halts you



You can probably check using the 8 TAS



id rather check with a wk at the bottom left of 22



to see if it halts wk momentum

Pog



Question, since it's not required on the GUR2 boards, is recording required?



it is for gur1



its not for gur2 because that game is dead as shit



and requiring video proof would just make it worse



I'll probably be streaming it so not a big deal



I wish GUR2 was more active cause that games fun as shit to run



@meowmeow1225 LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO :pogu:



@TripleHaven Welcome! Yes full video proof is required. If you're streaming, you can post in #live if you wanna plug yourself

{Reactions}
pogu (2) 


Yea sadly I wasn’t recording my time so I can’t get on the leaderboard lol



Maybe a controversial opinion, but I think we should only require video proof for sub 5 min times
Lose a lot of runs and so because of the fact that people don't record.



Of course this wouldn't help @meowmeow1225's case but thought I said it



congratulations on the great time btw



You're right, that is controversial



but I don't entirely disagree



I know some games that do that



Yeah, and I think we should to. The more runs that get's submitted the more activity the game shows and the better is the chanse of people finding us



I think SM64 DS has that rule



Exactly, some big speedrunning title does that. then require live stream for like sub whatever



That's something you'll have to bring up with merpell though



yeah, But I assume he'll see this too



I think I'd still vote against it, but it's not up to me



actually idk, I'd have to think about it for a while



I just think that sure, that opens up the oportunity for cheaters. BUT
1. If you're a cheater you're either a good player that just can't get it up to the top. well better than 5 min
2. You are lazy and if you just played the game for like a couple of minutes you won't get a 5 min time just because you won't die by lava
3. Well, when does ever a cheater settle with a 27th place?



I'm personally leaning against a rule like this but I'm happy to discuss



hey guys



About the submission for 5 minutes or above



I think we should only ask for a print screen a photo of their time



just to fill the blank you know



that would help a lot to grow the community



yeah obviously a scrnsht is what i meant as well



yeah



I will say that cheating by photoshopping the end screen will be difficult because of the game's visual effects



and as pudding said: who would cheat for 27th place?



if it requires SC proof for >5 minutes then im fine with that



its a little janky but it should let more people submit runs



its so cool to see the server growing, I remember when the number of online people used to outsize the offline people



and yea its very very hard to fake the end screen



yeah



and even if someone puts in the effort to do it, congrats you get like 30th place or something



exactly

I sure hope so



SWEDES?



we already have lol



yeah, but MORE



hey merpell



are u going to add the plus 5 minutes only screnshot thingy?



im not sure yet



ok wait so how do i actually use the SWF file in resourecs?



you have to download the flash player



👍



and then open the file on it



it's this one, right?



https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html



yep



it starts with the file



then they do menu macros



and then start to show inputs



and then the cursed sidenotes



whats after that?



it haunts me every night



"23 wallkick never"



that got me when I saw it



ok, so i installed flash, but its not giving me the option to open the swf file with flash



open flash



go to archive



at the right top



click in open



and then select ur file



use the link towny sent



which of the download links should i click



and dl the flash content debugger



ok



👍



files working now



thanks guys



np



ok yea you guys are right this shit is goated lmao

im good exept for level 50



level 50 im bad



Same :lul:



GUR runs at 30fps right?



idk



im good except for lvl 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,443,44,45,46,47,48,49 and exceptionally 50



11 im good



Hahahahahaha you skipped 11 :lul:



KEEKEKEKEKEKEKE



11 i have tied wr man



KEEKEKEKEKEK



> GUR runs at 30fps right?
@LycroP2 ?



I have no clue



ask @SensualPudding



he knows the code



30



i searched the serve history



thats a good pinned idk



just for quick knowledge for new players



Give UP Robot runs at 30 FPS



I thought it ran at 60...
But some peaople argued against it last time



hmmmmm



most of you guys were saying 30



It definitely looks like 60



hmmmmmm



so i have no fucking clue then



Frame counters count over 30 for me that that mustn't mean the game runs at over 30



and the TAS version def runs at 60 and to my knowlage i didn't change the framerate



60 it is



Level 2 TAS has 119 frames for 1.98 seconds. Lines up perfectly



ok so



sorry for saying shit



wont be so confident next time



It's all good lol



lol
We didn't bully you mate



owned with facts and logic



ok so \:D



explains why wallkicks are so fucking hard



a frame is a planck length of a second



rtd probably caps his game at 30 fps smh



this explains everything



what a little bitch



:YEPsad: jk i love you rtd and i had a lot of fun playing among us yesterday:YEPsad:



yup same

the leaderboard would be a minefield

yo my pb is in the leaderboards

its also in this channel like 10 times



and about the bot



no clue why the bot spazzed out and its logs are gone so i guess thats just a mystery



i restarted it so who knows ??? it worked fine for a couple weeks



why the fuck does one of the embeds say 0th place



o_o



lmao



cuz dude's so good that he cant even be in the same leaderboards cuz it would be unfair



i wish the bot didnt go self aware and not keep logs for some reason so i could actually debug this



I think vickey got a new PB if @merpell wants to verify and test the bot 👀



imagined being tested by the god vickey



what an honor for @Speedbot



i also dont know why it turned emojis into question marks

the question marks are funny haha

yeah it just got really confused because they were so close together

i had no hope that youd come back lmao



i was gonna ask if you got the kongregate message yeah



Was that you?



uhh no it was cyclowns iirc



but i was in vc with him when he sent it



Yeah I am not active on Kong at all. I logged in today just cause and saw I had 4 PMs



Do y'all speedrun hard mode?



no ur too op



😱



we should do a hardmode tas



but yeah you still have hardmode wr



Someone submitted my hard mode to speedrun.com



That TAS is delightful



yeah it's been improved by like half a second too



but its not really noticeable enough for us to want to reupload



That wall kick is hilarious



zoommmmmm



You should start running again



I think I noticed the instahook a couple times but couldn't replicate it well



And also "Hyper Speed Grapple"



i dont think any of us knew about it until davi joined to bring it up



I think I only used a bug/exploit in one level, but idr



24 right



the hyperspeed grapple to skip two of the blocks



🤣 I love this game



was the only bug that was used for a good while



So many creative ways to bypass the intended way to complete levels



yeah especially with wallkicks lmao



Ooohi have a spreadsheet to share with yall



if I can find it



oh what of



GUR stuff



, i figured



A ton of fun weird things you can do



ah alright



Found it! 😄



~~i was hoping you were gonna say "old world records" but that's also nice~~



There's also a sheet with some hard mode times, but you'd have to decipher what they mean lol

since we all thought rtdrtd67 was the first person to break the 4 minute barrier until we saw your video with a 3:59 from like 2012



and then the description said that you beat the old record by less than a second



which would imply that someone else  also got a 3:59



I think they got like 4:00.xx



None of those "challenges" are speedrunning stuff



Just fun "casual" stuff



this is speedrunning stuff

lol yeah



Gotta love that name lol



yea lmao



we also got a horizontal hsg working at the end that skips the last moving block



that you usually have to wait on til it moves up



Oooh nice



I speedran this and played with a bunch of friends back in the day on Kong. So many memories



id imagine you beat out your friends



to say the least



They were all pretty good, but yeah I definitely played the most



LOL level 44 is great



LOVE IT



Uhhh



Idr, but I _think_ level 45 can be done faster than the TAS



some people tried to skip the block



i never tried it myself but according to everyone else it just doesnt work



If you get on top of the block I think I remember you could? But maybe not, or it was a different level



Damn, that level 50...



you probably can get on the block but then you miss out on the hsg wallkick at the end



so whether or not its faster would be close



also that 44 is part of the evil trinity of balls hard rta strats



the other two being 35 and 36



the tas does something different for 36 though



If you end up running hard mode, level 5 in my hard mode run has a skip



You can swing past the last block



And you can launch over the block on 7



Ohhh hard mode level 8 is the skip I was thinking of



You actually can get on the block sooner



You should try making a TAS of hard
You know all the tricks so no reason to reinvent the wheel



I should stream a playthrough of GUR



Maybe I'll even do it now before work



:pogu:



we got #live if you need to plug



Where do y'all play?



And what will you do when Flash gets deprecated in December?



we have a swf



so we'll just use swf player



The official flash player will stop working but there's always flash players



I'll hop onto Twitch shortly



Be warned, I haven't played in years, so it'll be abysmal



I should've done it before watching the vids so that I wouldbt actually remember how to do stuff



@Doggo What site do you use to play for now?



Mostly we use the swf player now as well



i use blipz



but most people use the swf yea



I actually might not be able to stream right now; one of the services at work just failed and I gotta help. I'll let y'all know when I do.



Where can I find the SWF? @Doggo



should be on the src page



(src is speedrun.com)



I'm gonna hop on and stream for 30m-1h. It'd be easier to use the SWF than record a section of the screen with OBS



ok ty



What SWF player do ya use?



Personally I use Adobes version



i didnt know there was more than one



Ye, adobe's is the best I'd say, do that one



I can't seem to find the standalone player, only flash for web



https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html



I think it's "Flash Player projector content debugger"



Yay! Thanks.



YOOOO MAISTLIN



I'm live. https://twitch.tv/maistlinrajere



dude ur good af



Thanks 😊



I was shocked when I discovered that you had a sub4 like 8 years ago



hey guys, your eyes in your balls cuz this guy is going to stole them



hehe this joke never gets old



yooooooooo



surprised the kongregate dm worked



@MaistlinRajere nice profile picture



tbh this is the best timeline



now we just need arcanod to join, lol



yeah we haven't really tried to reach out to arcanod



guess you gotta get a kongregate dm out to him too :LELW:



we could prolly comment on his yt videos



he responds to those occasionally



Can you wall kick if you're not on the ground?



yes



yes



if youre falling it'll be a lot weaker



it's limp though but a litle



but if youre rising then its about the same



So can it be done on level 20 to kick off the left wall?

Don't think it would get enough speed. and take a little to setup
But maybe, a good idea



Is there a speedrun category for no exploits?



I think that 20 is done rta though so can proly be faster



e.g. no wallkicks?



been talks about it but no



but rtd is the only one using wallkicks, you can get sub 3:30 without



yeah theres *at most* seven levels that use bugs rta



22, 23, 24, 32, 43, 46, 50



wks are crazy precise



hsg in 24 43 46, hhsg in 50, wk in 22 23 32



so dont usually bother in rta



And could you theoretically wallkick off of the blinky death blocks if you're a pixel away?



yeah



yes



i think it happens in 14



happens in a lot of levels in the tas



i think the first is 7



How do you guys make the tas



sensual made a swf that reads notepad files as inputs



there's an thing where you downloaded the swf called "gur trainer"



edited SWF that allows input from a textifle



sensual is a wizard



^



I just see so many opportunities for improvements and would consider helping



you're always welcome to improve



Probably don't want to actually get back into speedrunning it



we've made a few improvements



LOL the skip in rtd's 46 is great



45 is improvable but so long that no one bothers, otherwise I don't think we know any for sure



in the WR



43 and 46 are really fun



off the top of my head:
- limp wallkicks in 6, 29, 34 to get downward momentum faster
- extra wallkick at the start of 5, 14
- wallkick at the end of 46
- way better wallkick in 42
- 37 isn't rta anymore



and overall better movement from sensual in a few levels like 48



wallkicks make you go faster than max running speed right?



yeah



And max swinging speed?



uhhh i dont think swinging speed has a max



max base swinging speed from a normal block



but not from spinners i assume



yeah spinners should be a lot faster



Max swinging speed would be if you release it at exactly 90 degrees I assume



yeah



should be



oh and if you want to look at the input files or anything just ask in #tas and we'll give it to you



@MaistlinRajere Welcome! You're the hardmode wr holder, right? Good to have you



Thanks @Towny !



1 more and we have 30 people on the server!



(not counting the bot btw)



bot rights matter



thas crazy... I remember joining when there were like 4 people lul



i said *people*
> bot rights matter
@merpell people*



i remember joining when there were 2 :omegalul:



lmao



I think I joined when there was 8



or 9



i think i was the 2nd or 3rd person in



if rtd is the creator of the server



and merpell the more active mod



i imagine he was the second cuz he had to add it to the site



i was 2nd

stonks



how can I see the old leaderboards with the wayback machine?



i would like to have a look on it



i think src actually has a feature like that



where?



filter (top right by submit run) > date



nooo, I mean the adult swin leaderboards



the REALLY OLD leaderboards



there's a link somewhere in the discord



to see it i need the url



wow thats good



you can search through for it



somewhere around the score calculator pin



it should be somewhere in there



found it



https://web.archive.org/web/20120221112419/http://highscores.adultswim.com/highscores/index.jsp?game=3172&filter=0&itemsPerPage=50



yeah



thanks \:D



@MaistlinRajere you know anyone on the archived leaderboards?



how do i calculate the time?



i found a way to reverse engineer time from score and a couple were under 4 min



score to points



there's a Google sheet somewhere



one i made and one hetheis made



there is, but i dont understand how to do it



copy the sheet then input score



14 seconds? wtf i must be doing something wrong



or just cheats lol



yeah now it worked



thanks for the help \:D



top couple are cheated



one of them seems maybe legit



like a 3:58



i think



but it's impossible to say



so that's the best time excluding the cheaters hmmmm

this is very unsettling



what is that



Hyper speed grapple, I thought



I didnt play gur for a day then realized how bad i had gotten with out playing for 1 day



@cyclowns nope I don't recognize anyone on the leaderboards



Is that 3:59.53 me?



someone named TapeWormJoe



Pretty sure the top two cheated, because theres no way you can beat the game in 14 seconds, or whatever the fuck would give you a score of 2 billion



top 2 are cheated for sure, #3 MIGHT be but we dont have anything to go off of



the rest may or may not be but it isnt really consequential



What a relic

First one in a run
And 43 HSG, never usually do that either

Why won't you verify runs @merpell



NEED to see my wr



Oh no, I will loose my
"Verified by zachsk"



@Zach 
Verify it, need the special verifier. can't loose that



dw only have 5 runs waiting to verify



5
Jeez



ill verify em tonight don't worry



or do worry:monkaS:



hey merpell ,why dont you add one more verificator? I know it must be boring to have to do it so why dont add one more? (an active one, im not very active)



Yeah, could replace jumpyluff or what his name is. Haven't seen a verify be that dude in years and years



I'll get to it



Whaaat, will I get the green verify again. Amazing



fuck it, im starting 32 wallkicks



you will regret that decision



PSA, leaderboard will be broken for 30 mins-1 hr while i reformat

no new runners are being accepted at this time due to NICE circumstances



> would you rather be purple or yellow
@merpell id rather be hoisted as tas author than segmented runner



at least until the segmented run is actually done



but id also rather be yellow cus yellow pfp



nah i mean like i can change the role colors for u if you want



ah ok so we chillin



yea



this yellow looks like ass on light mode though lol



i usually use #EEDD00



cus it looks fine on both



Why would you use light mode???



who tf uses light mode on discord tho fr



i cant be asked to switch to dark mode on everything else



I thought they got rid of light mode



and switching from dark gray discord to white anything else hurts my eyes more than constant white



I chanced the colour a bit to your prefered yellow



yea this works ty



this is not as blinding of a yellow



little bit tamer



like towny's src yellow



do yall have your src colors memorized lol

the vps its on isnt the fastes tbut



like when you get a 4:30 its "great run, hopefully next time i can get 50 in less tries, very proud of the 31-40 split though i dont know when i'll top that"



then when you get 3:35 its "29 bad"



lol true



Lycro is about to snipe you doggo



more like towny is about to snipe merpell in hard mode



if he doesnt quit before then



Just got the sub 3 today 😎



still havent submitted it tho 🙄



i got a 3 minute something in hard mode but just never submitted it



idk if i have the video



hard mode is just not as fun imo



NO. FUCKING. WAY
I bean benny:pogu:



Noce
Congratulations



You are now the second best swede :pogu:



Soon to be the best...



What did you get?



Pff
Good luck dude, I'd be happy if you got up here to compete a little



Wtf. You have an endscreen and thumbnail and everything dude



Looking out for the sub 5 though



Yeah, hope you guy's don't mind some lo-fi
Always listen to spotify in the background so not edited in or anything like that
Don't know the rules, are game music required?



nah



I don't know. I don't think game music is a rule?
I'm not a mod but don't think so



Exactly



Yeah, just video is fine. I play music over a muted game these days



rtd's are always completely silent



That seems awkward
Want something to listen to, even if it's bad music or some commentary



I guess you get mesmorized by his godlike skills



I think I'm the only active user that streams attempts with commentary lol



He's the wr holder right, so gotta be good. or I'm thinking of someone else



Ahh, nice, Have to check in sometime



Sensual took the world record yesterday



Not anymore he isn't 😅



NOOOOOOOO
Why, why
You of all people:YEPsad:



AAA, congratulations on the new WR though, amazing work



Thank you



i believe in swede supremacy



Exactly, everybody be talking about white supremacy these days and completly forgets about the swedes
We are worth the most and are defenetly supreme



You are now considered a very smart and amazing person in my books @Doggo 
a real champ



lmao



even got that cool swedish yellow there:pogu:



There should be a sweden role though, should be at the absolute top



Awww, blue and yellow are already taken though:YEPsad::monkaS:



You're one patriot if I ever saw one😅



YOOOOO VICKEY



much respect for you bro



YOOOOO Lycro, my favourite unknown😎😍

It actually does. Well I guess I live in gurgang now. shit
Sure hope it's in sweden otherwise I'll quit this gang

Nothing will change our supariority, not even this amazing gang



wut
gurgang is a song

It's slapping though



oh wow



It's so strange, quite like it. this will be my new theme to all my vids

dues slapping in the music



I would say that's "unique"

very unique, feels like i'm in some sort of a cult or something



EXACTLY lmao



The blood sacrifice coming up for the gurgang



the russian sacrifice



a russian duo (or trio?)



damn russians and their confuse names



no no, it's easy
Demitri or Vladimir
That's all there is and I'll accept as real russians, the rest are FAKE



FAKE NEWS



SUKA BLYAT



There we go, Sub 5 has been achived and is up for verification



Have a question for all you godly players
Is it better to run and be better and better with my current tricks or is it better to try and learn all of thouse launching 24 and 46 first?



I mean, HSG is a absolute must to get some better times and not super hard to learn on some levels. I'd go for learning that

Wallkicks and faster 50 and so on I would put of to learn untill a little bit later when you feel more comfortable with the game though



okay, noted



gratz on the sub 5!!



As for your question, learning new tricks is always good, but deaths are going to be your greatest time loss. Check out Arcanod's record from like 7 years ago. Back then there really were no big tricks, and he still pulled off a 4:06 just by not dying



But I would say definitely try to learn them. They might save a dead run



Ahhh, true
So It's like possible to pull of sub 4 without 50 and 22



I have been trying 50 but god damn that's hard. how tf do you do that



It would be REALLY hard to get a sub 4 without newer strats. Arcanods run is almost flawless if I remember correctly.



Also yeah, 50 will break you



it still breaks me sometimes



So no special tricks to get 50 easier. just have to get better?



> Arcanods run is almost flawless
didnt he think that sub 29 on 1-10 was incredibly hard



Yeah I can't say there's anything too special. Just keep practicing, eventually you'll get better at measuring where you'll swing based on your distance to the wall



like tas-only hard



> didnt he think that sub 29 on 1-10 was incredibly hard
@Doggo Yeah, but he always sucked at level 1



Yeah, he should see the TAS now



sub 22 1-10 is tas-only hard :neko_catstare:



and 9



oh yeah he didnt do the 9 thing



Jesus christ, sub 22 1-10
Didn't relize that when isaw it
That's so quick



no its 22.07



but 5 6 and 8 are outdated



still like 13 seconds faster that I do it because I'm bad



i mean yea its a tas lol



true true



OH WAIT



you can totally limpkick at the start of 36 and save like .02



loll



unless the shaft is so narrow that wallkicks just dont work



Yeah, I wrote that in that strat idea column



oh did you



i havent checked it in a while



If you mean as in getting to falling speed faster



yeah thats what limpkick means



Aa, yeah



Wouldn't save to much but maybe a frame or 2



i mean yea limpkicks have saved likee



.11 over the whole tas lol



half of that coming from 34



Those small saves really do add up



there haven't really been any big discoveries since the tas and its still been improved by like .7 yea



And could probably be improved by another second+ just by better movement



im surprised my 18 is still holding up



im pretty sure i had to purposefully make the grapple release a frame slower so that the wallkick actually landed me on the ending platform



its ludicrously close



Maybe could be done a frame quicker somehow then. This game got some wonky mechanics so hard to know exactly what to do

@MaistlinRajere do not tell me you guys found wallkicks before us too LOL



yeah how wtf



I guess you can climb up the wall and slide over the edge



(on 36) why is this not a super challenge lol

climb? UP???



Just like hard 10



??



Like the challenge on hard 10 I mean



even then how would you land on the top



Well can't you climb up the inner wall, the when you high enough grab the outer wall to the right and just make it shorter and land on top



oh the rightmost wall fair enough



didnt visualize that part



???????????????????????????????????????????



are we talking about the same game



no



Towny is so confused



I mean i can't really explain it better sorry



~~no "dont jump" challenge for 28, not pog~~



~~quite 4weird if i do say so myself~~



The second sheet on @MaistlinRajere sheet. Is that IL times for hard???

That would be fun if it were



~~also using all three spinners in 30 is harder than either of the challenges~~

Ehhhh...



I think the mod got cheated



On no what, it changed now. I'm sorry



idk what kind of 3rd party thing ur viewing it on but it is changed



What



Ye, saw that



he submitted it as 4:48 and i changed it to 4:58 before verifying



huh



Sorry



nah u good, thats weird



oh fuck. I'm stupid with math
I'll change the title



happens to the best of us



and the sneakiest of us 😉



Sad that you noticed my little trick. Now I have to activly go for the record instead of cheating



oh whoops i meant to put 4:04 not 3:26 silly me



classic doggo



WTF. I actually pulled of 46 HSG, failed 24 and did 46

pogu 


And were my very very first sub minute 1-20



~~you're already doing 46 hsg?~~



grars on the pb though



looking forward to the 53 second 1-20



Have to say that you're getting pretty good pretty fasy @Vicckeey



I mean it's only been like a week or 10 days since you had over 6 min



first time I did 46 HSG, wanted to try it out



i wouldnt bother with 46 hsg tbh



worry about learning 50 skips



Thank you Pudd
I'm coming for you, look out for me



yeah, I try but that's so hard. But I think I'll do like 10 or 20 50  a day so I'll learn some day



On 50 skip, should I stay on the falling platform because That's a little easier. Or i should learn to go directly for the send part?



as long as you're not waiting for the moving block youre saving wayyy too much time to care about small stuff like that



for your skill level



Aaa, so just make it easier to get concistency up I guess is smart



yeah dont go for crazy shit until you have the fundamentals



Yeah I mean. I always stay on the falling block for consistency



we're talking abt the 3 falling platforms after the spinner right



Then I will do that, and no last launch either for now
Thank you



yeah, exaclty



cool



hsg at the end you could go for, it saves like five seconds



but i wouldnt recommend it cus its the very last input of the run so High Nerves



I'll get 50 down forst but have to learn hsg as well



yo vicckeey



just as a heads up



emojis dont work on src



oh nooo
I haven't noticed



I mean, it doesn't hurt right



you just sound really unsure of yourself when you make your descriptions



What, how?



you go from "I'm coming for you bitch" to "I'm coming for you bitch????"



O nooooo
not questionmarks



LOL



no wonder nobody has taken my warnings seriously



i saw lycro and cyclowns say "I'm coming for you???" i was confused but thought it was funny



way funnier with context



lol



So now I have like 5 unsure descriptions



ill get rid of the question marks on them if you really want me to



Nah, it's all cool
a fun memory



\:)



@Doggo yeah you can climb up the wall on 23. It's a mega bitch though. And 36 I don't remember what to do. I think it might be what the TAS did.

@SensualPudding I think it might be IL times, but I don't actually remember.



i know what you do for 36 but its way harder than basically everything that isnt labeled super challenge or higher



hey @merpell If i stream and get a PB. can I just link the entire vod and where the run beggins?



yep that works if you wanna do that



or you could highlight it of course but i have no preference



Don't really know how to get highlights but I can try. Looks a bit better maybe



just whatever you did for your last run is what i meant



aaa, okay. Just link it all then



whatever's easiest



.run latest



is the bot off



.run newest



.run normal newest



No run for `newest` in category `normal` found! Either they aren't on the leaderboards or are a guest user.



.run normal latest



No run for `latest` in category `normal` found! Either they aren't on the leaderboards or are a guest user.



okay whatever, I was just gonna say there's a new runner on the board

Also Tazdrongo just liked my comment on his PB. Epic



wr by over 3 and a half mins on the first run? truly inspirational



hey @SensualPudding 
You're the programmer here right?
Any possibility for you to make an automatic splitter for livesplit?



i dont think there's any way for something like that to work in gur



you could program something, but it's a tall order



programming AI aint easy



oh, that's sad
I know that they read memory in like fallout and half life to pause at loads



Yeah I mean you could technically read the momry of the game and make it auto pause when you see it loads or whatever you want to.

But it would pose a big issue if the GUR timer isn't correct or anything like that. Would make it incorrect because it's better than the game



there is a way



i can try and make an autosplitter



also it's just .newest

3:44 first 30 :pogu:



this guy has spent 2 full minutes dying to the same 3 spots on 42, this is actually painful



yeah im gonna reject it, this guy spent 30s doing nothing at the start of 43 and a full minute doing nothing at the start of 48, actually laughable



Oh nooo, but he would pose such a good challenge to all of us



yeah a challenge to be slower than him



:lul:



lol



Jeez @Vicckeey
Just checked the leder boards because I heard there were a lot of new things today and you're 14th!!
You're climbing quickly dude



<https://clips.twitch.tv/InexpensiveGracefulPandaCharlieBitMe>



looks tough



no way he



stonks save



Who's the one who uses a controller?



yo



🤚



How do you remap it?



I use JoyToKey



God, I despise advertisements that say DOWNLOAD



or START YOUR DOWNLOAD NOW



It should be illegal



has anyone thought about death%



Just a quick question Towny
Wouldn't a controller remaped ad a slight delay to inputs?
I don't really know how stuff like that works just thought



what would death% mean?



I don't feel any latency with it tbh



Basically a speedrun where you die



And then you win



That's just level 1 then lol



LOL yea



that's just my normal runs :YEPsad:

{Reactions}
YEPsad (2) 


so basically do level 1 as fast as possible



you can optimize with a limpkick while falling in 2



death% tas would be INSANE



die in every level (except 1) then beat it



my favorite extended category in any game is Dank% for OoT



Bah, JoyToKey is not user friendly



Works fine for me



~~not what user friendly means~~



^



It is not intuitive to use



Works fine for me



ok buddy



Well yes, everything is intuitive when you already know how to use it



I can help you if you need



That'd be great.



Hop into voice chat?



sure, 1 sec



What does "Show IL Times" do?



where on src?



after you beat a level it shows the level time



he means on gurtrainer



I barely know myself. It's so buggy
But I think that when you go into a normal mode and not level select it shows the IL times



In the game optionns menu



ah nvm



il stands for individual level



img uessing you knew that



yeah



But in level select I think it shows either way



Does the trainer offer a way to quickly restart a level?



"r"



esc if you want to quit to the main menu



Ans TAB next level BACKSPACE past



oh nice



esc doesnt quit to menu for me i have to restart the program



hmmm,strange
for me it goes back to the starting page when I'm in level select at least



i tried level select and new game



are the buttons editable



maybe i changed it and dont remember



nope, can't be changed



but the rest of the shortcuts work?



ye



Then I don't know
Strange



you might be using the earlier version



true true, maybe



I still use 2.0



im using 2.0



2.0 is way less buggy but doesn't have TAS things and stuff like that
Or maybe it does, don't remember what I added



Yeah I like 2.0 so I'm not constantly creating files when I practice



really should make that an option if you want that
as well as fixing all the bugs



GURtrainer 4.0 :pogu:



Don't really have alot of time rn, but maybe one day



Yeah I mean 2.0 works fine for me for now



Are there new features that would be wanted in a 4.0?



GUR nude mod

{Reactions}
YEP 


Ooooh



You could probably charge a subscription fee for that



write down all features and bugs in the #deleted-channel channel And I'll start thinking about it



Savestates would be glorious



I would consider learning how to do it



windows keeps blocking me from using GURtrainer



is there something i need to do



There's not really anything that should be harmful
A warning can come up because they want towrite files. A block though I don't know



"Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."



oh wait i can run it anyways

Well crap, I think the hardest challenge isn't not using the block on H11



I think it's not using the blocks on H8



Is that even possible



Yep. I just did it right before I said that



Good luck ^_^



Oh I should mention that there is a config file you can change the save threshold for each level

Right now it only saves levels under a sertain time so probably didn't save that blickless right



Fun fact
13% of all GUR submitted times EVER got submitted this month. What happened



tas



tas is the only thing that happened



Probably
But TAS has been out a while

I guess it took a while to get the new players starting



Well, when you look into in vicckeey is the reason for 11 of the submissions...
Oj



ah



But...
We have gotten a few new runners recently so TAS definitely helped

I mean it got like 90 likes or something



89



Using gur trainer is fine during regular runs right



I just like being able to esc to reset



Nope, only original swf



^



Pinned a message.



just pinning the decompiled files cause i needed it



biggest of all time :pogu:

it says 12

that game looks cool

Need more players to beat that
How would we bribe people to get here?



hmmmmmmmmmm



well, when we have a full-game gide I can almost guarantee that will bring players



if we all share it



I'm asking myself why the game statistics shows 9 but the games page says 12



maybe the games page has a bigger time window to count as active players



Maybe the game page counts rejected runs as well



HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM



Or mods
9 + 3 = 12



Maybe the statistics page just doesn't like you

{Reactions}
😭 


^



> Or mods
> 9 + 3 = 12
@SensualPudding make sense



> Maybe the statistics page just doesn't like you
@MaistlinRajere WE CAN'T DISCARD THAT



So I _think_ that with the decompiled files one could theoretically create new levels



wait



WUT



GUR mods 2021 or bust



imagine a mod of gur



You would have to recompile the game though



it's not rejected runs, I've only rejected one in the last month or so



Keep on trying, Robot



and i don't think it's mods either because it's been less than 3 before



hmmmm



You Suck, Robot



I think @cyclowns was working on an level editor



youve seen tall 24



now get ready for long 44



no pls



How do you make a game be an official release in src?



Do you need a developer word or something?



i dont think the person who submitted Actual Real-Life Pencil Sharpening got dev approval



unless he was an angel



Would be nice if some of you top players would do a GDQ agan, would be really cool



I would do it live



That would be fun



And have a few of you on the couch



towny assuming he's the runner



I'd help commentate that



do you think we are gonna get on stage



get hyped up by the commentators before we start the run



fail 1 skip



and just keep going



I think it's worth a try to try to get in next time



I think whoever is best at wallkicks should do it 😄



@rtdrtd67
Guess it's you



rtd is best at rta wallkicks



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xGWKroE15g



unfortunately same cannot be said for tas



datvideo quality



I can't find the video of like 4:00



there was video????



I thought there was



I guess I was wrong



> towny assuming he's the runner
@rtdrtd67 there goes your couch space 😦



most of us would probably take your couch space for sending mario goatse



:0



but to be real though, doesn't GDQ have a requirement that you have some kind of personality online? Since I'm the only one who streams with face or even voice on, it would probably be me



so smd :KEKW:



maistlin streams w voice



tru



Would they let me drink on stage



Would be strange to play with a controller
But Towny seems like the best pick for me. Because he's a talker and that's important even though rtd's games look way more impressive

Maistlin is kinda new so I don't know



Maistlins been playing longer than any of us tbh



if i did a run at gdq it would probably have 30 deaths



Yeye, I just mean that I don't know much about him



so nervous



ahh



Well guys, I'm flattered you elected me



I accept



or yknow we could do some race



Yeah I'm not a talker



they have those 4 way races



4 way GDQ race :pogu:



Race is a good idea



Hard mode race



normal + hardmode



+ H11 deathless



that would actually take probably 10+ minutes



theyve held celeste bingo right



What is celeste bingo



bingo board with things in celeste that take a lot of time to go out of your way to do



like doing pico-8



and getting hearts



and stuff



two people compete with the same board



fun



and if one person gets a spot then the its taken and other person cant



Ooooooh



hard to implement with gur because gur is way more linear



but you could do stuff



Yeah



Did y'all see me utterly fail at the final screen of celeste chapter 9 last night



~~did you get ||moon berry||~~



Nah



I was trying to do sub-3 hour



Ended up at 3:23



https://clips.twitch.tv/ZealousOptimisticQuailUncleNox



That was literally the end



I had a bet with a viewer that I could do it in under 3 hours



If I did he was gonna buy me Untitled Goose Game cause he speedruns it



that looks fake as fuck lol



It wasn't 😢



"There we don't fucking go" :lul:



chapter 9 is so fun to run



i think my best is like 40 minutes



i mostly just run chapter 9 and mods



O.o



Yeah mods are fun



i want to see how fast i could do ch 9



I'd watch that



wait i forgot to come back to your stream :(



i was gonna tune in later that night



see if you made it



I did.



I'll probably play again tonight



pog



im gonna stream my first try at ch9 speedrun



i wanna try and get a 20 something minute time



i can get sub 30 ez



get farewell gold before summit b gold



sub 30 minutes?



yeah



:\



ive done low death runs



to practice gold



i get like 27 minutes



:/



i think?



:<



i have 197 berries and im skipping 5-8b to go straight to fw xd



celeste :KEKW:

{Reactions}
⬇️ (2) 


I got 201 berries legit ^_^



yo nice



7b scares me



202nd was assist mode for ch9 gold



7 is reflection?



Reflection is ASS



7 is summit



Oh yeah



i got really fuckin bored of goldens



❤️ summit



so i just play mods



i dont think reflection looks that bad tbh



b side gold



but i havent tried it



mods are sick



i havent played community pack yet



but ive played some other popular ones



glyph is great



D sidess?



i just didn't like grinding the same easy levels forever trying to not die to random shit



yeah ive gotten to 7d



i just want to be able to say i did it, also only like 110 people have fw gold so theres that



i got stuck on 1 level in 2d



it was a stamina puzzle



i gave up



the last screen of 2d is hell



ive heard to skip 3 and 4 and go to 5d



bc its the next easiest



i skipped 3d for a while



4 is not hard but it's annoying



its basically playing in a snowstorm



i have a lot of long term celeste goals, all berries, sub 20 fw, top 100 any%, all d sides



ill get them all eventually



5 is REALLY Finn



fum



fun



strokelowns



i watched some of 5



because of the theo puzzles



i want to play it



what is strokelowns



just cause he fat fingered 'fun' so many times



idk



oh



i use swipe on my phone



stroke + cyclowns



i c



swipe can be either really good or really bad



so it autocorrect to random shit sometimes



i saw you playing poe one time are you a long time player



i started playing recently and got to act 7 and got bored i was just curious if maybe you played a lot



yeah ive been playing for a long time like maybe since 2015



but im a more casual player than most ppl



never beaten any of the endgame bosses or gotten a character to lvl 90 cause i just get bored of a character before then



Yeah the community that still plays seems very into it



I feel like gameplay for the arc witch i was playing was just right click things and they die. If I’m about to take damage I press r and then I get a shield and do more damage. Gameplay felt repetitive.



I do like the idea of making a build from scratch but I know way to little about the game to try that



there are builds that are more involved



but yeah if you do self cast spells sometimes its just right click to kill things



which is still fun sometimes if you're using a fun skill



like tornado shot or something that explodes corpses



a lot of the fun for me comes from watching packs explode and trying to manage movement and working on a build



so even if the actual gameplay is a lil repetitive depending on what skill its still fun



I can see that



Might try another build then



What do you suggest for fun



spectre necromancer was one of my favorite builds i ever played

You have to beat the game as fast as possible using the NumLock arrows



lycro about to level up



I've just been watching a bit of speedrun stuff on yt and relized something
Do we have an official twitter and yt channel etc.?



Not to my knowledge
Maybe but don't think so



nah



Is GUR signed up for the GSA speedrun game showcase?
If not you should, there's always like a few houndred people watching the streams, so will widen this game a little at least



I feel like I'm some kind of advertiser here, have a lot of things I ask you
Hope you don't mi,d
Just want to make this game BOOM and be bigger



O yea i still need to stream w/ facecam/mic so i can have a ‘presence’ and actually signup for that thing



the last day to sign up is the 18th so prolly should sign up before you forget it



Hmmm yea



Who else wants me to sign them up we could maybe do some x-way race



im down



ah actually they don't require a presence



just a VOD



What should we send them?



I'd probably wanna send one of my PBs



no they want a VOD minimum of 2 hours



to show u can stream 720p



or whatever



O they also want a video submission of a run w/ commentary



"Brief explanation of why you think this is a great speedrun, race or exhibition to showcase during our event"



something something creator of celeste



GUR compressing the video is not gonna look 720, but they'll have to take my word on it lol



and I could whip up a run



with commentary



alright i think we should just get on vc later today and we can fill out together



in school rn

If ya'll gonna do it
Remember rule no 1 to make people exited and come to the game

Underpromise tricks, and overhype when they succeed

You know like the AGDQ of F - ZERO GX



32 wallkicks :pogu:



Exactly
Say that it's like impossible and only mad men would even try for it this late in a good game

WOOOO, HE MADE IT. ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN?!!!??
Only TAS IS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT



@here anyone wanna join us for the GSA race submission?



How do you mean?



do you wanna race normal mode with me and rtd for the GSA showcase?



LOL



Sure, if you want an 8 minute run



well townys already doing an 8 minute run

Might come back to this speedrun later but I'll be satisfied with my sub 20 for now
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2oBiC_QZZu4/maxresdefault.jpg



You're a beast



So I've been here since 2016, I've speedrun this game for fucking 4 years. Though I did take like a 3 year break in the middle but shhhhh. And I've never seen a 15 active players beside the GUR game. It's huge
And 16 when a new HARD wr is submitted

The TAS and I think this discord really has helped this game to grow. And I have to say, IT'S FUN



im not counted in there either



and ive been doing runs



doubt rtd is counted either



I should try and submit a hard run and we're up to 17. Plus you too that isn't counted because you're like maxed and can't improve. Almost 20



next time i stream ill do a blind hard run just to have one to submit

{Reactions}
pogu 


then maybe work on it and make it not awful



i cant be last place



I'd Prolly be pretty close to last place. I've been trying a few runs lately and tbh. Vicckeey has a better pb then me. Hard is just, so fucking hard😅
Need a deathless run before I submit so I don't have to be as embarrassed



i feel



my friend dragged me back into playing osu and im having fun with the game again :c



this isnt good



i got back into playing when i got a tablet a bit ago



my tablet broke



and i refuse to buy another one



im mouse player now



i kind of want a tablet but learning mouse is fun too



i much prefer tablet over mouse



i did too when i played like 2 years ago



only issue is that i'm left handed but i tap with my left hand



so i had to learn how to grip a pen with my right hand



and now im kind of ambidextrous



thats cool



did make learning tablet a lot harder though lmao

tbf that would probably be a pretty good vid



lots of interesting progression



especially with all the new tricks



If we paid some thousands he would *think* and say no lol



hard to have suspense when the wr has been beaten like



six? times



nah



15ish i would say



Yeah it hasn't really been any wr races or anything like it to cover



btspider -> arcanod -> merpell -> cyclowns -> rtd -> cyclowns again -> rtd again -> sensual



is all im aware of



well that rtd again section



has like 4



well sure but rtd beat his records a ton



not a factor for suspense



true



he'd just b like



over the next month



rtd beat his own record 3 more times



"but then secret reptilian speedrunners and arcanod actually never had the wr"



could maybe work



And then a reptile reappears from the ashes (so it would be a phoenix) MAISTLIN COMES BACK TO LIVE



phoenix*



Yup, misspeled



Thx \:D



stupid word spelling wise anyway



np



ye phoenix sucks



1 more new player and Tazdrongo will be in 69th place



are u assuuming that taz won't be faster than the new player



I feel like that's a safe assumption to make



do you guys remember when the server only had the general, guides, live and vc?



the ol' times



i remember when the server just had general

het, what do you guys think of a kind of 100% (bad name i know) category, where you have to beat the normal and hard mode in sucession?



please, come up with better name ideas



mine sucks ik



and @Klice congrats on the sub20 \:D



Hey, so did ya'll sign up for the speedrun thing or not?
In case you did you'll have to tell me how you did



O we already filled out the form with the runners two nights ago



We can prob msg them on discord if u wanna join the race as well



Nah, I don't want to. Just wondered if you guys did it but it seems you did.
Well when you get an awnser make sure to tell everyone when you're running so we can see



ngl, rtd profile pic looks kinda sus



mad sus



Joined the server.



Yo, welcome



Hello



you're the one that's so close to a sub 5 time right

good luck getting there



Thanks

unrelated but im already getting giddy over how horribly poorly aged the old 11 skip shitposts are gonna get if the tas ever actually improves 11



it feels very possible



tas: improves lvl 11 with insane new strat
rtd: hmmmm seems doable



its definitely gonna be by like .02 if it does happen



well



but theres way more to work with now that going under is a strat



improvements are improvements rigth? even if slightly



holy my typing is bad today



and I can't even blame it on alcohol like towny



i can probably get a poorly aged post from like every active



except the new two



vick and maist



which one would be mine? I talk so many bs that would be hard to choose only 1

Yeah. 2:02.100

Towny went from 2:30 to 2:18 to 2:11



At this rate he'll be sub 1:00 next week

I was second for less than a day



not even verified



im kms



bye



i had a 6 second death on lvl 5



not even verified more like not even submitted :KEKW:



IM PLAYING MINECRAFT YA CUNT



oi cunt



wtf @merpell you're a beast at H1



Is sub 1:00 1-20 good?



I got 57.62



yeah that's pretty good



I think I average 54-55



ahhhhh I wked on 23 into the sponner



RIP



lol f



23 wallkicks are never worth it for me. They don't save as much time as 32, you pretty much gotta get it first try to save any time



And I can never manage to get the HSG on 24



Any tips?



Are you having trouble getting yourself wedged under the block, or actually releasing on time?



Releasing



When I did it just now I only went halfway up



That usually happens to me when I try to do it too fast, and I don't get enough "tension"



Do you need wait for the block to be higher?



So I buffer my first grapple a bit so that I'm sure the first block is done moving by the time I go for it



ok



Yeah the first block has to pretty much be done moving I think



And what's a good time on 1?



mid 4 seconds



I reset if it isnt sub 5



O.o



I barely got sub 5 and thought it was good



imagine resetting low 5 KEKW



yeah, its definitely the hardest level lol



nah don't reset on 5



I am convinced you two are robots

{Reactions}
widebot (2) YEP 


i reset if it isnt like sub 4.8



lol



that's why u play w no game timer



should maybe not do that but I'm a perfectionist



yea



but it's more convenientfor ppl watching



so i keep it on



I notice that when you reset a level with GUR trainer, there's a delay



From when the timer starts and when you can move



just tap right a few times in between death and lvl start



What's that do?



the input just doesnt carry over quite correctly



you just have to reset your walking input basically



I also can't get the timing right to start moving before you can actually see stuff on level 1



LOL



I think you can sideways HSG on level 1



By clipping a corner



Not sure



for sure there are many locations



doesn't seem viable/consistent when 1 can already be done quite quickly



OK I got 4.37 on 1



Am I good yet?



@Towny



yeah thats good



and there will always be like 19 frames where you can't move before a level starts



nah its not that



i know what he means



I think merpell is mistaking your problem for a problem I had where I just wouldn't be able to move until I reset the input?



:KEKW: ?



wat



I don't play on the 3.0 gur trainer, so I wouldn't know



2.0 trainer life



Also if you reset right before you die, you die after it resets



and if you die in the game you die in real life



ow



gg



On 5, has anyone tried extending the grapple before the ledge so that you grab the spinner while it's retracting?



And is it faster



I've tried it, I don't think it's any faster



but I haven't messed around with it extensively



htf do yall do 7 so consistetly



That shit is so close to the laval



Retract as you're spinning



just gotta practice that timing



it doesnt have to be perfect either



just get it decent and itll get better over time bc youll play 7 a lot as you do attempts



imagine retracting on 7



or 8 for that matter



How about sub 27 1-10? Is that good? 🙂



did u just get sub 27



Almost?



niceeee



ya sub 27 is amazing

i've gotten sub 27 once before



I've been practicing 1-10 for the past few hours lol



beats my gold



i believe no one else has



😦



What did you get?



I'll share my splits if you want



he got like a 26.75



share them golds



here are mine

rtd how do you keep track of your golds? You don't use livesplit, right?



nah lol notepad



1: 4.37
2: 2.07
3: 2.12
4: 2.42
5: 2.62
6: 3.10
7: 2.45
8: 2.22
9: 2.65
10: 3.02



and quick maths



You really do quick math to determine your split times every single time you complete 10 levels?



well most of the time i can just eye it



and see it's nowhere close to gold



but yea if i see it's close



i'll do the subtraction



wow



Are any of those records?



Cause they fucking felt like it



no where close lol



😢



our segmented 1-10 is 24.83 lol



Is tehre a vid for 22 TAS?



Yeasssss



I got a 17.33 H11 wtf



And I have the txt file for it. I can die happy now



I've only done the level 24 trick about 10 times and im not very good at it lol



takes practice for sure



ye im trying to perfect it rn



pretty tight window to get upward momentum at all, even tighter to get enough to clear the level



Im in class and im play gur for some reason



That's the absolute best place to play gur though



ikr



what do u play on



i play on keyboard



everyone here plays on keyboard except towny who uses an nes controller



afaik



conrtoller would be weird to play on



I use a controller too



BTW I got a 7.62 H3 RTA last night



i've gotten 7.4



but it has two wks



:\



I got the wk at the start



I swear, that attempt was perfect except for not wking at the end



yea my middle section sucked



cause i haven't played hardmode enough



My 8bitdo controller is on the way, I'll see if playing with controller is as good as towny says



I think I just ate a pound of donut holes wtf



you good?



purge time



Im looking for a song to learn on piano, im curently doing the first movement of moonlight sonata



learn the GUR soundtrack



but seriously, the first songs I learned on the piano were Ocarina of Time songs



hm ok



my uncle started with mario themes



mostly smw themes



he says they're not that hard to learn



yea a lot of VGM is simple and easy to learn because you probably already know it



+ fun because you can show off to ppl and they'll probably understand what you're playing



yup



I would learn piano if my house had space to play it, I can't even fit a keyboard in my house



i want to learn keyboard eventually



me too



VGM?



video game music



@SensualPudding Do you have a txt file for H3 TAS that I can look at?

Hard level 1 6.77 Give up, Robot
back from the grave beating the segmented time by 0.1
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zoUXZYU3Hpk/maxresdefault.jpg



i did a lil somethin



beats the time on the segmented spreadsheet by 0.1 secs



back from the dead to snag a segmented time



you bet your ass



how do i write it on the spreadsheet?



Just set your name, change the time and link the vid in the time as proof



aight



how about that timeframe



Frae time is just somthing used to easier edit it, don't have to chnage it



okay



btw why is MaistlinRajere labeled as an Absolute Legend



because he is



Because He has held the HARD record for like 8 years and got a sub 4 ages ago



ooooooh was he the guy we calculated to be the one who got sub 4



> tapewormjoe had (according to my spreadsheet and the leaderboard) a sub-4 in 2010
@hetheis this one?



nope, Maistlin just got a vid on his channel, much eaasier. no calculation needed



damn okay



sick



I saw you guys cursing the speedbot with the in-game sentences



so, is GUR robot name Speedbot?



🤔



Ingame sentences?



6.77 hard 1 :KEKW:



does anyone have the link for sensual puddings gur trainer



it should be on the speedrun.com page



ok



i think there's a newer version but the one on src works just fine



this 24 skip is killing me rn



I'm actually not convinced that I can get sub 6 on Hard 1



Sub 6 on H1 is amazing...
The TAS is 5:80 I think

GG!!!



Hey would 2 people who are able to stream GUR on discord wanna help me real quick sometime today? Just need to figure out some dimensions because I wanna start designing the background for the tourney matches



:YEP:



@SensualPudding My best on 1 is 6.2

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfIrV-dzgC0/maxresdefault.jpg



should we have IL leaderboards?



I'm down



but merpell would have to do it



my goal for the segmented run just kinda got shifted into the TAS stuff and now its just IL time competition



Yes please have that



so i think actual IL leaderboards would be sick



if we do that then we maybe need more src mods though



but I mean IL leaderboards would be like 61 categories with like 3 runs in each



some even just 1 i think



nothing wrong with that in principle



if people dont care about IL times they wont look at it



only issue is the logistics of it



The problem with IL runs is that we'll have to officially accept emulators or my version



hmmm



good point



but disallow it for full runs



which is a little too grey area



I mean, could only be acceptable on IL runs though



Exactly



is there any huge issue with allowing GUR trainer though?



in full runs as well



Don't think so no



if people want to use modified SWFs they just can without it being visible anyawy



the only potential issue is that the game might play moderately differently but i dont think it does and that would have to be demonstarted



Full runs i wouldn't want to accept this. Don't know if the timing and thing is correct and you know



i think allowing GUR trainer for IL runs is fine



because people kinda need it



Yeah, for IL it should be perfectly fine



If it'll be accepted for full runs I'll have to make some kind of special thing for that so I know it's good for sure



why is it a big deal?



its not like we have to submit them as emulator runs



its just a lil awkward when full runs dont allow modified SWFs but IL runs would



even if we do submit them as emu runs its still not a big deal



Well if full runs can use a modified swf I wouldn't be comfortable using GurTrainer 3 though
In that case I want to split it into one GurTrainer and one for TAS usage



i have my barebones IL time SWF



im not planning on making gurtrainer legal for full game



Yeah, that would work fine



Good



i think the SWF i made might be buggy though



because its modified pcode and stuff



so, IL leaderboards on src soon?



whereas gur trainer is like actual flash project isnt it



so why cant we just use the gur trainer for ils and the standard swf for full game?



tas capabgility in gur trianer



probably



older version?



Yes it is. Can send you the source so you can do a flash project if you wanna



we can, but it may look "strange" but i'm in favor of this split



gurtrainer for IL's and original SWF for fullgame runs



need some official version for IL times though



without tas tools



yeah, that's a good call



2.0 doesnt have tas tools tho does it?



you gave me the source a while back



for gurtrainer



Don't think it does no



Yeah but I meant like the raw GUR source



ah i have that too



the IL file just need the ability to choose levels



nothing more (other than what the original file already has)



we can justrepackage 2.0 as like official IL run thing



^ thats what im saying



and guides for how to use it would be good



#guides revival :pogu:



I think the 2.0 idea sounds good



you say revival but was it ever alive



Though I think pressing O on 2.0 gets up some kind of basic tas file choosing menu. But would look like a split when it starts I think



> tas capabgility in gur trianer
@cyclowns doesn't it say that you've used the TAS tools at the end of the level tho



It should say that yes but I don't know anymore, 3.0 is like soooooo fucking bad and buggy I'm ashamed. But it should say tas usage



Maybe it doesn't in the level select though



But IL times on src would be amazing. Would bring the active players and recent runs up



heheboey



Would be a real pain in the ass for merpell though when it just opens and there's like 200 runs waiting to get verified



that's why I still think that the game page on src  needs at least one more moderator



i can mod



helps with testing the bot and shit



I'd be down if you are
I mean any of the admins could be really. Trust you all enough for that



Not saying all, saying any*
Not fucking all, cyclowns a good choice



yup



tbh 200 il runs is not that bad



they're short so ain't that bad, but 1 more mod wouldn't hurt anyone



any of the discord admins are a good choice to a be a src mod



we just see who has the more time available and boom



hey @Doggo when are you going to grind for a new PB? you have a lot of IL's



I mean, look what happened with sensual



i have



three ils



and one is a tie



lol



yeah, but I still think you could go up a lot, you're very good \:D



He's right though, you're very talented



you can get a sub4 easily



holy shit 46 HSG saves 2 whole seconds



going to use it in runs



just need to be more consistent



hey guys, if IL's in src may be a thing, what do you guys think about segments?



1-10 11-20 and etc



in this file for IL's we could have also a segments option



tbf you could just use the standard swf for segments



and it shows the 5 game segments
1-10
11-20
21-30
31-40
41-50
and hardmode too
1-5
6-11



but i get what you mean



> tbf you could just use the standard swf for segments
@merpell but what if I want to do 31-40?



nah i get you



yay \:D



it would be cool



so close to 55 ;-;

PauseChamp



how did it go



i messed up in 43 HSG a lot of times



:YEPsad:



when i messed up the first time my energy was gone



i know that feel

{Reactions}
YEPsad 


it happens



incredbly i didnt miss 50 fast



but i missed 50 hsg



lol



i saw it on src and



until lvl 40



im tied with klice's 3:51 pb



(if I hadnt died on 40 1 time)



you were tied with me at 30



WTF? lol no way



my last segment fucking sucks



towny splits up to 40 :KEKW: 
towny 41-50 split :monkas:



> towny splits up to 40 :KEKW: 
> towny 41-50 split :monkas:
@merpell what did he mean by this



🤔



lmao i was tied



i meant



everything



couldnt believe



monkas



:monkaS:



that just proves that my last segment is completely trash



but i'll improve it (some day?)



I can't believe your pb is still 4:22



lol



like your 1-30 is almost perfect



my problem is 41-50, i'm acceptably ok until there



> like your 1-30 is almost perfect
@Towny I think it's cause until there I restart if I miss anything



41-50 is everyone's problem



i try to copy from the top runners as much as possible until then



your 31-40 loses like 7 seconds over my pace



yea 41-50 is just the hardest split by far



if 2:35 is your average



not that surprising



but yeah last 10 levels are the biggest roadblock

{Reactions}
YEPsad 


yeah, i'm watching your pb now trying to see what i can improve



> if 2:35 is your average
@Towny i wouldnt say my average



my average is by the 2:43 cuz most of the times i go slow on something



do not miss completely, but dont go optimally



this one i just popped off



> not that surprising
@cyclowns yeah



im gonna start running again and get a 3:2x out of pure pent up anger from losing a 3:3x run to 43 5 times in a row



do it



:pogu:



cyclowns coming back :pogu:



while you were playing hardmode i was studying the blade

{Reactions}
lul 


THE OG WR HOLDER



lol you remembered me when someone put: "former wr holder" at the side of cyclowns name on the IL's spreadsheet when he had 0 IL's wr



While we were streaming minecraft, you mastered the wallkick



i do remember that, that was me lol



dude be like: I mastered 1-10 more time than you mastered your whole game



ok i technically didnt have 0 IL wrs



i tied like 3 of them



11, 11, and 11

{Reactions}
omegalul 


4 if you count 11 but



its just a given that i would beast on level 11 im simply too good



i once had lvl2 tied wr, but then that mf pudding managed to get a fking 1.99



how the fuck can someone do that



ill tie lvl 11 il wr on stream right now



oh i had the IL for 3, 10, and 46 at one point but they got beaten



and i nevr bothered actually putting them on the sheet



lol imagine being so good that you dont even care about people acknowledging it



kind of sad that i got mega burn out right when the cool shit was happening



like IL stuff and tas



yeah I remember racing you like once, and then you went kinda silent



@Towny on my 1-40 pb i missed 36 fast strat and my 39 was (actually it is) really bad and of course i died on 40



so we can take off 4 seconds from that mistakes i think



3 seconds to save yet



how the fuck am i supposed to do that



like 1sec off 1-20



just takes some optimal movement



hmmmmm yeah i think that being optimal between the whole run would save that



but towny was tied with me until 30 so i lost time from 31 >



honestly the time you can save by optimizing the end of 39 is a lot more than it seems. Other than that, just tighter timing will add up



serious?



39 doesnt seem like that "time-savable"



its possible to do the end of it pretty slowly



and lose like 1sec



same with 45



hmmmmmmm



I'm looking at your PB btw



4:22



ºoº



that's where I'm seeing your 39



okok



yo why did i never think about what you did in your pb in lvl 40



its so much better



you dont need to time anything



hooly shit im dumb



You mean just extending yourself to the platform?



yeah it's more consistent for me for sure



but it takes a little getting use to it



as far as I know, I'm the only one who does it



i think if i come back i gota change how i grind



like be more lenient



i would reset whenever i got like a 28.xx on 1-10



towny how tf is this run 3:39 your 1-30 was so shit



guess i suck



i clutched the end



I did 43 and 46 too



only died on 47 cause of course I do



ok i have to be doing something wrong for 1-20 because i can barely get a 54 time with a 27 1-10 and sensuals wr is like 27.8 with a 54.28 1-20



and it doesnt feel like i do itany differently



Nah that’s rust



nah i mean even b4 i rusted



When i come back my 1-20 is shit for 2 days



Ah



my avg was like 55.1



unless im misremembering



Prob lvl 20



yea im assuming



actually no i got it wrong



my avg is like 54.5



oh yeah, we're all doing 6 wk now, so



i was thinking that i dont get 53 ever



but that is probably normal



im just gonna start derusting with the mind that like



im gonna be shit for a lil bit



no game timer
not gonna reset 4 no reason



gonna try and do 32 wk if possible



> You mean just extending yourself to the platform?
@Towny  exactly, it's so much better, how did I never thought about it



is 23 wk any different than 32



im assuming u just dont go for both cuz that shit is hard



@cyclowns gonna join the tourney since you're back on the grind?



is there a tourney



also 23 and 32 are the exact same but 32 saves more time



since the spinner is lower



yeah, sign up on challonge

if u want



radical



@Doggo you got reseeded like you wanted lmao



but now you fight rtd after maistlin



i have easy matchups



towny and merpell



you're fucking dead, kiddo



i beat both of your PBs in a race at 1 am i will do it again



you did?



yea at one point



i got like a 3:50 in a race



obv that doesnt beat them now



Oh that was when we raced



that was a while back



true, but you'll be a good match for this tourney



it'll probably be some time in november so you got time to derust



i think for derusting im just gonna gocus on being consistent



gocus



focus



instead of learning wks and shit first



I waited until sub 3:40 to do wallkicks



So, if the IL leaderboards come to life, which i really really hope they do, would streamable be accepted or no because it gets removed after a while?
You see, I kinda lost my IL recordings and I'm nver beating that 50



wait really?



that lvl 50 is never going to be saw again?



wtf



> I waited until sub 3:40 to do wallkicks
@Towny i dont do wallkicks  at all lol



Well it exists on streamable and maybe cyclowns got a copy?
But yeah, all my IL times are lost



dammit

Hi I have an question how long it take to be on the leaderboard ? I did submit my run but afterwards I did beat it is it all right if I submit it ?



Yeah it's alright, submit both and merpell will take care of it
Better to submit then not to



ok thank you have an great day ! 🙂



yeah, it usually takes 1 day, at most 4 if merpell is really ocuppied



sub 16 in 50 fast :0

now its a must do in my runs



hell yeah, get ready for a fat PB



i commited to it saying that ill only do 50fast after i had a decent pb



> hell yeah, get ready for a fat PB
@Towny lets hope so



im inconsistent af at it



when i pass arcanod in the leaderboards ill always do 43 and 46 HSG



those 2 are hard af



minesweeper is actually a fun game to do fast



idk if id call it a speedrun



agreed



minesweeper is fun

Anyone else have issues with OBS not capturing the flash player?



nope, works fine for me



if you're tryna capture the trainer, its a different window



the trainer is an EXE



Nah, capturing the regular one



no I never have problems with it



For WR runs



Do you use game capture? window capture?



I use window capture



^



i use window capture ye



game capture seems broken



ah



game capture only works with fullscreen



window capture, pretty sure game capture only works on fullscreen applications



i think



game capture works for fullscreen games



did we all three just



oh i never use fullscreen on anything so that explains it

idk why its so much bigger than the window but you can drag it outside of the frame



yea it does the asme for me



i just resize it



never seen that



cus i play gur on blipz



so i just display capture and crop it to only show gur



which is why the borders on all my vids are the blipz background lol



How do you crop it



right click, filters



then add crop



Pro streemerz



hold down alt and drag sides



that works?



ye



god streamer klice



gg



wtf i didnt know you could crop



in hindsight why wouldnt that be a thing



oh by crop i just meant make the capture huge and move it so only the part i want is onscreen



didnt know you could actually crop



its alright doggo



time for some sub 2 attempts >:D



i stopped listening to you when you said you play on blipz

you have to use your grapple

oh?



YEEEEAAAAAAAHHHH



Is it maybe possible to wkunder the moving block at the beginning of 5?



Then somehow manage to go up it?



moving block on 5?



(hard 5)



ye we know



i didn't kek



i figured but idk why towny would be confused othereise



yea



KEK



doesn't look like there's enough height



or space



you could probably tas it, but theres no way it saves time



actually, i take it back you probably can't



not enough time before the block would crush you



If I take a wee break between 5 and 6 is a submission still valid?

um



depends



if we're talking a quickun



sure



if we're taking our sweet time



no go



Quick like 15 minutes?



Or like 2 days?



i would say 3 years max



i grab a beer and get worried itll get rejected



I don't think I have enough memory on my PC for a 3yr video



Maybe if I stream it and store it in the cloud



15 minutes is kind of long



how big is your bladder



How about long enough to come in here and brag how good I am



Cause I got a sub 35 1-5



im assuming "wee" break means "wee wee"



wee = small



I understand the pain of restarting 50%+ runs on level 1



H1 is annoying AF to do right



I think I've reached my Ballmer Peak.

further supporting the theory that you are a reptile



Lol I could've had wr but I suck



you'll get em next time maistlin!



yeah you'll NEVER get the hardmode wr



noob



Kek



I'm trolling ya I beat the WR

I couldve had sub 2 but I suck



time?



2:00.75



:KEKW:



you do suck



Fuck off



thats a rip



😢



:widebot:



on this episode of 'how does maistlin improve the record so little with 10s of timesave'



Y'all are so mean to me 😭



reminds me of my normal mode sub 4. I had like 4 runs get so close



Btw that was with 2 deaths



I could've gotten so much faster if I didn't try to fucking do 8 skip



hah 8 skip



I failed miserably in the exact same spot



Twoce



you got a 2 minute time with a failure on 8?



Yeah, right at the beginning



god amn



ahhh i thought you meant like, you died on the swing



i was like fuck how good was your 1-7??? lol



I missed the block 🤦‍♂️



:YEPsad:



I swear I could've probably hit sub 1:55



I was trying to do 8 skip by getting on top of the righthand block



WHAT THE FUCK



what the? fuck



I think OBS stopped the stream in the middle



I'm gonna murder OBS



Should I share the partial video?



that's a big f

damn



well



you know what they say



"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"

at least it wasn't the sub 2



honestly yea



thanfully it wasnt sub 2 so that didnt get lost



or smile because it didnt happen as far as im concerned :KEKW:

🤦‍♂️ 


merpell's next time will be 2:00.76



18 active players wtf



Was this boom is playerbase because of the TAS?



i dont see any other reason



also because maistlin rejoined



nah you guys are missing the big picture stuff



And congrats on the improved PB/WR maistlin



its obviously magic

{Reactions}
🤯 


smh



so a lot of established people are running hardmode



which has added people who havent pbd normal in a while to the active players list



i think



Hmmmmmmm



Makes sense



Also
Over a 100 likes on the TAS video
That's a good milestone



the tas is actually flexing its view/like ratio on like literally every gur speedrun ever



that tas guy is just that much better at speedrunning than us 😔



TAS is a godlike player



GUR is currently the 163º most speedran game on src :pogu:



Let's get that to 150



if GUR was considered an official release we would be at 124º



> Let's get that to 150
@SensualPudding to get to 150º we need 2 more players



show the game to your friends lel



It's very exciting to see that the game grows so we'll Prolly hit that some day



yeah, if we launch a hard mode TAS i think we would get there quickly



> It's very exciting to see that the game grows 
@SensualPudding they grow so quickly :YEPsad:



yo @Towny I think I'll give controller a try when my new one arrives, do you have any tips or advices to using it?



> yo @Towny I think I'll give controller a try when my new one arrives, do you have any tips or advices to using it?
@LycroP2 Try to find one with minimal input latency, use JoyToKey to map it, and use x to jump. Welcome to the controller club 😎



> do you have any tips or advices to using it?
@LycroP2 dont



dont listen to these keyboard plebs



they're still stuck in the stone ages



says mr controller man who only knows how to use his thumbs



says the guy who jumps with up



SAYS THE GUY WHO DOESNT



> @LycroP2 Try to find one with minimal input latency, use JoyToKey to map it, and use x to jump. Welcome to the controller club 😎
@Towny i bought a 8bitdo controller, one of the best for what I'm intending to play with it



I wouldn't say welcome yet



I'll try out to see if i like it

Also, that video starts with a lady using the same controller I use LMAO



imagine never seeing a controller and then someone give it to you without knowing shit about it



> Also, that video starts with a lady using the same controller I use LMAO
@Towny xb360 they used



i didn't liked playing gur at a controller cuz the xbox one controller dont have a good dpad for platformers



They didn't use xbox controllers, they used logitech



Logitech F310 i think



like, its good for using secondary itens and potions etc, but not for platforming, its very stiff



> They didn't use xbox controllers, they used logitech
@Towny wait wut



i dindt pay much attention to it



lemme search it



the video had it at this view i thought it was an x360 controller lol

you got a link for that?



i want to speedrun smw too, love that game, that why i bought at the first place



> you got a link for that?
@merpell not a link, but i have the name:



8bitdo sn30 pro usb



they have a bluetooth version, with has rumble and the gyro aim



:pogu:  thx



but i dont care for any of that so i bought the usb one[



gyro aim :pogu:



yep, cuz it works on switch



> :pogu:  thx
@merpell np \:D



and for the quality it aint expensive



I mean, here in brasil it has a lot of taxes, but in the US its very cheap



there's also the sn30 pro plus



it have the two grips under it you know



idk the name



where you hold the controller



and it have analog triggers



but idc, for that i have my xone controller



what are your opinions on gyro aim?



imo it looks very tiring to use



and not that precise



but i never used, so i cant really say if its bad or not



Does SRC allow you to hold multiple places? i.e. I can have 1st and second for two runs?



no lmao



no



Darn 😦



Didn't think so anyways lol



bruh if that was the case



that would be so scuffed



i would be 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 12th, 15th.... for normal



rtd would have 2nd-5th locked down in normal lol



> Didn't think so anyways lol
@MaistlinRajere well, if you set to show obsolete runs it kind of shows it



if you do that it will have rtd multiple times at the top



a lot of rtd's and the sensual grind

why is give up robot considered an "unofficial release" on SRC? I feel like that's severely limiting our exposure since you have to select the option to have it show up on the most active games



I always thought that



i wanna know how to turn it into an official one



tbh im not sure



but idk the requisites



there isnt an option for it on the mod settings



is there a way you can contact someone about it?



it could bring a lot of people if we show up on the active games page



> there isnt an option for it on the mod settings
@merpell kind of good, imagine "roblox getting eaten by a girl" being an official release



and, yeah, that what i just said exists



> is there a way you can contact someone about it?
@Towny i would like to know too :(



theres a thread for it but tbf gur isnt much of an official release



i think it is cuz its in the devs page and all



i mean, the old page of mattmakesgames



if Roblox Speed Run 4 counts

bro



if gur isnt an official release then rsr4 definitely isnt lmao\



at least gur is a standalone game

they seem so



so i think it would take roughly 5 days at most



to them accept our request



i love how rsr has over 1k runs in its main category lmfao



lmao



I used to be great at roblox obstacle courses back when i was like 12



I wonder how much the game has changed in all these years



wanna know?



r/gocommitdie is great way to see it



its just gonna make me sad

its a roblox sub



so, is someone going to write the request or I can do it?



Merpell says he got it



idk if it has to have proof and all that its official

whats worse is it's 2017 nickelback



merpell played give up robot cuz it was literally what his computer could handle



ehh that song is pretty fire



the rest of 2017 nickelback im not so sure



merpell do you play on a mechanical or membrane keyboard?



It's okay merpell, we all have shitty music opinions



for gur i use membrane



why?



everything else mechanical



you need that tactility for the small inputs



if you have brown switches on your mechanical then i would use those



blues are probably good too



but reds suck



blue gang



blue gang



> but reds suck
@merpell yeah, I can see why



blue gang renamed to noise gang when



RT



i do like the noise



it makes me look savvy



im not saying its a bad noise im saying its a loud noise



btw idk if im using this expression (savvy) right, my frined told me that you can kind of say it when talking about tech



u good



so im using it right?



yea

thats membrane



is it



idk it doesnt look like membrane



yep, not sure if could a semi mechanical switch



it looks like some funky ass offbrand switch



i think its a semi



maybe what merpell said



but i still think thats a semi



yeah



probably offbrand



i use a mechanical



and its fine



it was a keyboard+mouse and those are always ass



man what the hell are you guys talking about



I am so lost on the keyboard meta



everything



> it was a keyboard+mouse and those are always ass
@Doggo so its probably not a mechanical



just pretend we're talking about beer towny you'll fit right in



mechanical keyboards have switches that determine like  the input delay and stuff i think



idr



i remember my computer nerd friend explaining it to me



why would you ever want more input delay though?



it came in one ear and probably got blocked by the earwax



cheaper



yep, theres the brand beers (membrane) and the handmade ones (mechanical)

looks very cool, but the resolution is shit



I wonder if one day the server will get big that we will need to have rules about off-topic :YEPsad:



i dont want it :YEPsad:



Yeah I love shooting the shit in #general



who doesnt



I think we have too many boards now tbh



yeah



what i always loved about this server is that its all summed up on general



like inteded, segmented, and trainer are never really gonna get used



trainer :KEKW:



segmented got obsoleted by tas yeah



but



having il wrs is still cool obviously



i think that #deleted-channel  aint a necessary for example



we could talk about it here just @ sensual



also



tas and segmented could merge into one maybe



idk if it would be much messy



> boards
idk where you got this from but wherever you did i want you to know that youre a nerd for it



why?



the term boards? Probably 4chan



theyre called channels lol



what are they called here?



oh channels



imo we should remove intended and gur trainer for the sake of simplicity



ye



and maybe merge tas and segmented into just one? what yall think about it



intended was a weird idea anyway

{Reactions}
KEKW 


done and done



fuck them boards

remove intended and gur-trainer and move hardmode to the general category?



yes



only exists bc we wanted a glitchless category but glitchless didnt change the run enough



look, we can all agree intended needs to go

👍 


but "intended" is wayyy too interpretable



alt categories :kekw:



maybe call the channel

YEET



> rename segmented to individual-levels and move it to general 👍
@Doggo i think we should merge it with tas



not really related



kind of, since both are comunnity work related



idk if you get what im saying



again the actual idea of the segmented run is obsoleted by tas



yea just change it to IL



> rename segmented to individual-levels and move it to general 👍
@Doggo I still like the idea of changing it to IL



ight done



its so strange seing general with more than 4 things



hang on let me order this by activity lol



done²



is tas an event?



good question



kind of?



idk how yet but we should share the channels in different categories



i havent thought of the names yet



but would be more organized than everything in general



discussion: general, hardmode, tas, ils, bot
resources(?): guides, live, tournament



resources is a good one



but idk if it fits totally



we have all the time in the world to think about it



i like live being in general



idk why



active: general hardmode tas live
not: guides tournament ils bot



(joke)



:KEKW:



tournament is more active than tas kekw



lel



jk



i have tas muted didnt realize



lel



resources: bot and guides



Also, for whoever owns the Google Docs spreadsheet, should we be worried about griefing of any kind? It keeps version history, so we could revert back in case of disaster right?



general:
general, live, hardmode, ils

resources:
bot, guides

events:
tas
tournament



what do yall think?



works for me



thats p good ngl



> Also, for whoever owns the Google Docs spreadsheet, should we be worried about griefing of any kind? It keeps version history, so we could revert back in case of disaster right?
@Towny yo, thats a serious thing, we didnt care much about it now cuz our community is small, but it would be good if we had to submit our ils in the channel and then some administrator had to put it there



maybe events above resources though



just because its more active



true



noice organization now



I've been adding some channel descriptions too



about the grief thing, it would be harder to take care of the IL's leaderboards but it would be safer



> I've been adding some channel descriptions too
@Towny noice!



maybe just give perms to a few people



general: total SFW clusterfuck, off-topic is totally allowed



> maybe just give perms to a few people
@merpell dont we already have the "trusted" thing? we could add it to the IL's leaderboard

30 works  for me



mustve done the wrong one works for me too lol



luckily those arent crazy levels



i saw a noti that said wr 3 secs i was like 😐



**A new run has been verified!**



oh fuck



i dont hink the bot knows how IL runs work



man it knows that runs been verified



it knows that much



but then it gets lost in the leaderboard abyss



it just kinda gets stuck when theres like 30 verified at once



oh did we add ils



ye



its all formatted



i put some of the wrs up there but got bored



is there a tutorial on how to wallkick?



wish someone did it in #guides



but not yet really, besides from messages in the discord



@DmGotSauce hold up next to a wall and grapple for exactly two frames



i just hold up against a wall
and then press Z and X really fast
then hold the other directio



cyclows said that



it is more complicated tho



wow ok thanks i’ll try both of those



i remember @Towny saiying it but i cant remember exactly



i mean a completely proper explanation would be



grapple a wall or ceiling close enough so that pressing up will snap you away from it, then press up and release grapple on the same frame that it snaps you away

{Reactions}
🤝 


like, you jump into a wall facing it while holding up arrow, and then press Z and X at the same time for 2 frames and hold the other direction right after



VERY hard



a guide on it would be godtier

Are you sure you don't need another mod? that qooq run took you 2 days to verify lol

it takes serious motivations to sit through the pain and suffering of a 9 minute run you know



especially when they dont say ez after every level



or 19 minutes



:YEPsad:



but that one got rejected lol



well if it ever gets too much for you, I wouldn't mind helping. I watch every new run anyway



IL times :pogu:
Now the currency active players will explode



And I've got the wr on 11 without even submitting



So.....
It's possible to TAS IL times on gurtrainer 3



That's true. We could have submitted times require the legacy trainer



Yeah, I think the cyclowns one is the only one thatshould be accepted
I mean don't hhave to redo the one that has been done but for the rest



Gur trainer have a buggy time screen so easy to tell apart



oh there excist a legacy tooooo



yeah your v2.0 trainer is still on SRC I think



so we need @merpell to change the "eligible for IL leaderboard" on the 3.0 on SRC



yeah that would be great



@merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell



I don't think streamable should be used for future time submission because vids on streamable will disapear



yeah i reuploaded all mine to youtube



I don't think I have my left
Think @cyclowns have most of them for his editing but otherwise I can loose my 1 and 50 i guess:monkaS:

tip: you can just add the letters "dl" to the end of streamable to download any video



Found them all with a digging program thankfully but thanks for the tip



@Towny @SensualPudding i made the ruleset include the trainer so that all the runs on the spreadsheet would be valid



can we change that and just grandfather in the old runs?



Cause it really would be so easy to cheat il records with TAS



with the 3.0 trainer



the 2.0 trainer and cyclowns swf don't have TAS, so they can still be used



Yeah, 3.0 is super TAS able
Not even hard



alright



Apparently I have a 2nd place SRC run of Super Stacker...

I think IL times will really help, easy to submit a short run



YEPP



i dont like to do this but...



@everyone, so we just launched the IL's leaderboards on SRC, why dont you guys try to submit some of your PB's?



lel



poor poor merpell



KEKEKEKEKEKE



we are telling him to add another mod, but he wont listen kek



exactly, he don't trust us



Someone should submit a run that has random shit in the middle just to see if he actually watches them



SKASKDASKDASKDDASK



Like 10 seconds of Rick Astley



hes streamed run verification

{Reactions}
pogu 


a run with open-butt mario in the middle of it



> exactly, he don't trust us
@SensualPudding ye :YEPsad:



he's going to look at this and then skip through the new runs to find dumb stuff instead of seeing if the run is legit

{Reactions}
😳 


i mean, in not saying i should be a mod, im not very active so i wouldnt make any difference, but cyclowns, sensual, rtd and towny  would be good mods



maybe if he's afraid of that he could add a verifier



you know, the one's which icon is the wooden swords



but i dont think he should be afraid of any of us griefing anything



yeah exactly, no one has to be a super mod



F



yo, speaking of mods, zach is really addicted to this FTB Presents stoneblock 2 dudes playing it non stop 24/7 😳 😳 😳



kek



Make me a mod so I can reject any run that beats my WR

oh nooooooo, to bad



H1 can go diaf



And so can H4



And H3



And H8



And fuck this shit



H4 is the best hard level though

The Towny Slide (New Give Up, Robot Trick)
This trick is a 2 frame window horizontal HSG. Discovered by yours truly. Definitely RTA viable. This is also my submission for level 40 IL World Record. PogU
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQmACa20Bos/maxresdefault.jpg



Thanks to rtd for challenging me to find an HSG on this level



Lol wtf



Fuck everything so much



When you get a PB but realize you didn't start recording...



WTFFFFFFFF TOWNY



IS IT HARD TO PERFORM?



2 frame window. So It's twice as easy as wallkicks, but 3 times harder than regular HSG



that math adds up trust me



🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️



What did you get?



@MaistlinRajere



Hard mode PB



Sub 2?



😬



when i start doing runs i just record at the start of the session and then stop after like an hour to delete the recording



and if i get somethin i dont ahve to worry



> 😬
@MaistlinRajerenoway



> 2 frame window. So It's twice as easy as wallkicks, but 3 times harder than regular HSG
@Towny dammit



If I told you what time I got you wouldn't believe me 😬



2:00.00



🙂



I got sub 2, yeah



LESSGOOOOOOOOO



better than not doing it \:D



But it doesn't count since there's no vid



its a pitty thats there no vid



but at least you have a little more experience at it kek



Yeah I guess



Time to take a break from GUR



I've been playing for like 5 hours



huhhh???



my eyes would die



5 hours in one sitting??!!!!?!?
👀👀👀



thats a man of determination



What if I told you I got sub 1:55



Didn't yu scrsht it?



And cursed my computer out when I saw it didn't record



Oh yeah I did



Let's see what time you got



Would you believe me if I said I got sub 1:45



NO



no



That's crazy



probably not



Wise choice @cyclowns



thats impossible the sub45



by now



TAS could do it



Yeah well TAS could do sub 1:20 as well



Actually sub 1:45 is doable if you do 11 skip



How much time does 11 skip save?



Depends
But for a human, Prolly not to much because you'd be real slow the second lava thing



Maybe a sec or 2 max I think



I'll find the screenshot.



It was definitely sub 1:55



pog



I'm probably gonna take a break from hard mode for like a week I am so mad

DAMN BOE



I don't really have motivation to try again



after a 5 year break



a week is reasonable



this is why you should stream all your attempts



well its why i do it anyway



I found a skip on 1 btw



skipping a block?



yeah



which one?



You can skip the 5th block by swinging from the 4th to the 6th



It's very hard to do, I've only done it like once but I think it saves time



The 5th
Is that the one that's super close and a bit higher?



yes



Aaa, don't think it's to useful but nice to know. The easiest skip is to skip the 4th block so wouldn't be able to use it



yoo i got the towny slideTM



the timing is very tight



but its 200% RTA viable



yo guys



dont you think your guides section on scr is kinda of bad?



like, the faster 18 and safer 22 are good guides



but the other two i cant say the same



@Towny how the fuck can you play with an controller



this shit is impossible



it feels so off



im trying it rn



idk, it just doesnt play right



looks like im playing another game



beating with gur with it will be a challenge alone

i mean, platforming with controller will always be better, but the grappling feels so strange



12:09



it was cool to kind of relearn the game



but grappling with controller feels very strange



@Towny you are capping yourself so much by using a cntroller lol



(believe me hes worse on keyboard)

@Doggo holy shit how



@Doggo what is that 18 strat holy cow



you mean the 8 i submitted? or tas 18

cause moving on spinners kills you

I think you can press O or P on 1.0 to download the input files
They may be unworking and so though sence it's an early thing



how would you



do that on a swf



Well on a swf you have to accept the thing. So you'll get up a Explorer window

former wr holder role when (also not biased)



tbh we should just rename the @.everyone role to  'il wr holder'



nah dont count ties



idk man



unless theyre the first person in the disc to get the time



what a shite role. Anyone can get wr in 11



oh wait



you just said don't count ties



ok



wow that was toxic



my bad



time to tie all of doggos il wrs so neither of us get the role



:YEPsad:



its better this way



now the question stands...
What happened to HARD WR?



HARD :omegalul:



oh yeah i should give that role to maistlin too



done



we should have a sub 4 club



(not biased)



we'll just make personal for everyone



we should have a PB succession WR holder



(not biased)



We should have a "sub-4 gang" role



Not biased since I wouldn't be a part of it lol



I wanted to quote @Towny  message but I couldn't for some reason so I just wrote it again



Should we remove the segmented time page and have it as an only TAS sheet now when we have an IL leaderboard?



Not yet, we're still transporting the information



Not all of the ILs are there yet I think



Let's wait a few days



Does someone know an program to change key bindings?



I'm left handed, so I wanna test if playing on WASD would improve my GUR gameplay



But idk a program to use



I think I've used SharpKeys before



is it free?



pretty sure ya



Or just use Microsofts PowerToys



NOICE



what is that?



PowerToys is like a bunch of different good to have thing that Microsoft game out, Keybindings one of them



ºoº



FancyZones is the only reason I use it tho
IT's AMAZIIIINGGGG



just a question, in this programs that you suggested, are they permanent re mapments or just when the program is open?



what is fancyzones?



Well It's while it's open but that's the deal with all apps
It's on in the background all the time though



wouldnt autohotkey also work to change keybindings ?



yes it would



I thought Microsoft PowerToys was their new brand of dildos

wait, we seriously have IL WR holder role but we dont have a sub-4 gang?



set swf player as a game



and name it "Give Up, Robot"



ºoº



thats cool to know, thanks!



when i start to put my profile as online im going to do that



> wait, we seriously have IL WR holder role but we dont have a sub-4 gang?
@LycroP2 I'm up for having a sub 4 gang
Or at least I think we should have a speedrunner role and make it show up different in the list. So we know who actually have times on the leaderboard

First ever?



The IL WR holder starts his journey towards the real deal



i did a few  casual runs



noice



btw this is random but has anyone here studied heisenberg's uncertainty principle?



Don't talk quantum physics here jeez
You Genius



no trust me i'm not learning it but it has relation to a college essay question I'm trying to do rn



wat about it



does it imply that if a particle's position/momentum is known with 100% accuracy than the corresponding attribute is completely unknown?



just that it can't be known with certainty



ya but the more certain one is known the less certain the other is known



yea



i guess if it's 100% then yeah



not known with any certainty



hmmmm yea



alright i guess I'll just bs this then



slightly  faster

o wow



what 3 lvls in a row for 31-40



34 35 36



34 isnt that hard



but i still choke it fairly often



37s a break and then 38 is also hard



o 36 is ez for me cuz i don't do the strat



34 is terrible



do you try to do fast shit in 34



i dont



kind of in between



i don't grapple instantly i wait like mid-way but i don't go for hole in one



i grapple mid way but i hold up and hug the ceiling anyway



which might just be even slower than normal strats lol



o yea then u may as well hug asap



golded 31-40



LOL



every split golded today



is that why your name is gold?



sure

ye and the 41-50 split is still bad



one death and no 50 skip



not even blockless?



i didnt do blockless



i did the hsg though



:KEKW:



honestly i knew itd gold anyway



so i just didnt risk it



and it golded by 15 seconds



my 41-50 gold is still not optimal and it's 1:05.49 :KEKW:

I just got 2 golds in a run then choked the sub 4 on 50



Rip



rip



o7



how tf is anyone consistant with level 41



muscle memory



I always grapple at the end



i grapple at the end if it looks like i need to



i always do unless i can tell its fine



too risky



My 41-50 is the only portion I'm genuially bad at it



thats generally true for everyone



its the hardest split and the one you get the least natural practice for



actually 21-30 is also really hard



which ones harder depends on which strats youre going for



NEW PB LFGGG :pogu: :pogu: :pogu:

i think 21-30 only really gets actually harder at mid level though, then once you get to high level strats in 43 and 46 + optimized 50 skip makes 41-50 harder again



oh shit



gg



Only 8 seconds better but still pog



I find 21-30 easy but I also dont do a lot of speedrun strats. Like I typically skip on fast 32



22 not fast 32



yoo sub 5



the majority of levels in 21-30 have dumb speedrun strats



actually basically all of them except 27 and 28



Where do I find footage whenni stop record9ng in streamlabs lmao



Nvm found it

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uIHE8QZjpF4/hqdefault.jpg



sub 4 on the way



good job @pansear ❤ you should record runs and get on the leaderboard



also good job @hetheis you're so close to the sub 4!



yeah ive been recording most of my runs



but i know i can still improve a lot so i havent submitted any



i submitted the 5:20 though



yeah, should upload them so can you see the improvement on SRC



Soon another Arcanod bop from Hetheis then



cool always good to see more people on the leaderboard



The arcanod bop is a historic moment for any GUR player. It's always said that we stand on the shoulders of giants, but fuck that, that loser doesn't even do 22 skip :LEL:



we're the giants now



i probably lost at least 30 seconds to  deaths



maybe even more



when I started running I thought his 4:6 were like so good, almost max

look at us



deaths will always be a real pain, the biggest time loss

I don't have good skips like rtd but fewer deaths so



i think i lost  10 seconds on 34 that run



i have no idea what happened there



34 can ruin any run, that level is cursed



i think  i should be able to get a sub 5 soon



and then i just need to learn better strats



just lost a  great run to  46



bad level



46 is pretty shit when you first start



46 is pretty shit ~~when you first start~~



then you realize whats making you fuck up ( bad controls on turnaround ) and it starts to get less shit when you adapt to that



then you learn the hsg and its shit again

(this is  why we use the hhsg)



just hhgs for all the dumb levels beucase theyre too hard



46, 50, etc



true



wait why is 43 hsg actually free



cuz it's easy



with good setup



43 hsg :omegalul:



so much shit happened while I was gone, damn



we have like 2 new runners



doggo made a return



loaded up gurtrainer for the first time in a while and did 50 hhsg first try



:POGGERS:



cyclowns back too damn



Yo, congrats on your new PB @Doggo , I said you could improve a lot, you can still improve even more youre good af :D



I just noticed that 3:2x is 200% possible since the towny slide™ has been discovered kek



ehh the towny slide only saves about half a second. But the 3:2x is very possible though



Yo, I was "training" lvl 30, to spin at the first spinner, and I noticed that sometimes the grapple goes against the spinner direction and it launches me in the lava, is this a instahook collateral effect?



that sounds like the same sort of thing in the lvl 8 il wr



It launches me up left instead of right, idk if it's instahook or not



wut



ive never had that happen before on 30



well that definitely sounds like instahook. Are you jumping?



sounds like instahook



I have video but I'm not at my PC now



I think so I don't remember 100%



Tomorrow I'll send it here



It's almost certainly instahook



I think that too



just submitted a run



what time ya get?



first full run after very light derusting

ft. 10 seconds of timeloss on 20



arcanod bop with 9 deaths



doggo spotted around several bridges recently



Cyclowns back :pogu:



merpell my run died at the end of 29 and the middle of 42 lol



no way i dont pb like this week



i believe



i also pb this week



gl



I'm at 15th now ;-;



4 places down, dammit this game is beggining to be real active



Rn we have more players than mirrors edge :pogu:



Mirror's edge is so fucking good



wtf thats actually pretty pog



wait what lmao



Would recommend to everyone, it's on my top 10 favorites



it helps that GUR is short and accessible though



only accessible for like



two more months



yeah a li lbit



Yo, talking about it



well we have all the files accessible



yea but its still a lot less likely that someone just stumbles on the game themselves



ye ofc



Don't you guys think that an cool art for the game photo on the src would be very healthy for the game?



Cuz like



we just gotta advertise da game more



TAS helped i think



If I don't know the game and see a menu screenshot as a photo I wouldn't be inclined to see it or run it



GUR is a very fucking good game, but the game photo in a SRC ain't the best, I know we don't have an official photo but



It would be cool to have some kind of header



i think tas helped a lot yeah



also ive been talking about it a bunch in the server i admin



which is where the last 3 joins are from



°o°



i talk about the game with my gf but shes sensitive to flashing lights soooooooo



not really a candidate for new runner



Well, so GUR definitely isn't for her



:(



ye thats reasonable



thats probably one of the main reasons this game isnt a super good speedgame



Most friends of mine that played it didn't have concerns, but I can see someone having it



along with the existence of 50



gur has the seeds of being a good speedgame



less autoscrollers and more predictable grapple physics would help



I think that 50 is good for the game, cuz makes that super pressure moment, you know?



but i think grapple physics are mostly ifne



grapple physics are only a major problem in levels like 20 imo



I think lvl 1 is bad for the fame



Game*



""major""



Cuz when I show lvl 1 strat to my friends they're like



level 1 would be bad if it werent well



level 1



its very easy to spam reset on



the worst o ffender of grapple physics is 48



easily



Fuck this game, I won't be resetting lvl 1 100 times lol



that level makes no fucking sense



oh true



I HATE LVL 48



48 EW



tried for hours to find a consistent setup



just doesnt work



MAN



i just wing it and it works half the time



A 48 SETUP



SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST



can we have 48 skip skip



48 IS ON FUCKING DRUGS



No48% when?



No1% when?



make skipping 48 on gur trainer legal when?



no hard 3%



no hard%

tru



I would be a tied WR holder with 0m 0s 0ms



tfw on a pb pace run going into 31-40 but its gur trainer 3

didnt take long for me to derust



it would've died on 50 anyways lets not kid ourselves



couldve died at any point in 41-50 really



died on 36 and 38



just gona say fuck it and keep going

Better start recording and running on GurTrainer 1 then



when im actually trying to go for ils i will



Holy shit I got a new record on normal mode \o/



wow that was a ong break



10:02



Am I good yet



how can you have sub 2 on hard and not even sub 10 on normal lol



Nobody fucking knows



sub 10 is my goal for normal



should submit them thogh so we all can feel good about ourselves



I had 67 deaths btw



@SensualPudding @rtdrtd67 whats your success rate with 32/23 wk



its more consistent than i thought it would be



what the fuck i wish i was recording



i just went full instinct and got 32 wk 5 times in a row



Nice! I got a sub 4 this time



I don't know, some days im almost 100% and some days i can't seem to do it very often, like 20-30%



To get to level 40 😆



the improvement..



yea i get it around 30-40%



i think its enough to be worth



40% is defenetly worth 1 shot every run



at least for 32



even if you fuck it up once on 32 you can still sometimes salvage and get it 2nd time



and that still saves like .8



yeah exactly, so can do it a few times



Ok went from 10 minutes o 6:25



How's that



your next time will be 3 minutes flat



At that rate I should have WR in like an hour



and then -30 seconds



I think Towny's HSG trick for 40 works on 42 as wekk



well



Smart, could actually do that

Don't think it saves time over the wallkick though



the wallkick is undoubtedly faster



HSG has to wait for the platform to reach it's apex

I have created the sub 4 club role



Welcome to the sub 4 club



we meet every saturday to circle jerk around our records and laugh at the plebs



and laugh at hetheis



especially maistlin



and me

POGGERS 


hehehe



seeing how fast you're improving, you'll get it soon enough



thx ;u;



about the WASD thingy, my muscle memory just kills it



impossible



just feels off ;--;



after years of playing one way, changing is hard lel



Hey dumb question when flash closes where can i play the game with html5



flash player is closing on web but you can still use offline flash player



the .swf is on the speedrun.com page, you should be able play it with a swf player



download https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html adobe flash projector content debugger



and the SWF (flash game files) are on the speedrun.com page



so you can play those using that tool



and it lets you play teh game offline even after flash dies



We got rejected from the GSA event 😐



not too surprised but rip



Yea me neither



The runs that got in r all p big names though, thought there wouldn’t be so many submissions



was there a reason for rejection, or was it just cause there were better games to fill the spot?



either way RIP



But I'm proud of us for doing that video at least



Would've been good if we got in, to bad really. well well, what can you do but try again next time



i keep trying to rush the last grapple in 50 to save a few seconds



but i always end up not getting enough distance  and dying



lost a sub 5 to that  twice now



Only means you'll get more practise and an even better time when you pull it off



i keep getting easy sub 5 pace runs



only to end up choking in 41-50 every time



41-50 will kill so many runs
When you're on a good pace the nerves kick in and makes it 2x harder



i want to get like  25th place or higher on src



and ive been  30 seconds ahead of that time in multiple runs



but my current pb is 30 seconds slower than it



You got some great IL times so I'm sure you'll get 25th easily if you grind for it



i mean   ils are a lot easier than full game runs



True that
Still shows you got some dedication



fair



I saw yesterday that a sub 4 gang were added. Also saw it were close in colour to the TAS role
So I checked it out and added a bunch of colours for a remake of the roles
At least I think it's necessary

Added like 3 shades per colour so you can have like an hierarchy in that role
ei. WR, sub, dpeedrunner
Or something idk

Just an idea because I think the colours look kinda messy



Haven't done it but up for a change or open a discussion about it



first sub 30 :pogu:

I mean if no one has any objections on the roles or colors of roles I'll change them in an hour
Can't change Admin or Owner though



sounds great



i am excited to see many colors



please keep the sub 4 club gold



its the most important color



also just to put this out there is there anything as accessible as streamable for IL times



really sucks that vids get deleted after a few months



can't think of one



honestly I'm gonna use youtube from now on and just keep them unlisted



yea i guess I should start doing t hat too



streamable is so convenient though....



it really is



it was really quick



Joined the server.



new bot?



Just for self roles so I can know who really is a speedrunner



Now everyone should have to read the welcome before entering and get assigned a role
Didn't know what rules you guys wanted or anything. Can revert all changes but thought we needed a welcome page



uhhh I think you locked general



Only for people that hasn't choosen a role
Didn't know any other way for people to get forced into the welcom channel



yeah idk if I like that



its gonna confuse new people



Then I'll revert it



I guess see what everyone else thinks, but I'd prefer to keep this place as open and accessible as possible



Probably the best



yea



also how would I edit the welcome message? it sounds good but there are a few typos



whgen you dont hjave image perms



i wanted to show a sr



yeah keep images open too



I destroyed the server it seems like



you did



> also how would I edit the welcome message? it sounds good but there are a few typos
@rtdrtd67 Just send me it and I'll change the bot

why is there a link to the gur2 boards in the gur1 discord :KEKW:



Man I break rules 2 3 and 4 every day on this damn server



guess you guys can ban me now



mario goatse

{Reactions}
YEP 


yeah sensual the welcome message should prob be edited a bit



I feel like it should focus less on rules, and more on links and information about the game



i feel like it gives off an intimidating aura



We've never had a problem with uncivility here



yeah i was gonna say that too rtd, feels a little intimidating



Sure, I can remove rules and add some info and links instead
What you guys want?



As you may have noticed I'm not exactly a good writer so if you could post some info or some shit I'll add it to the bot



If it were up to me I wouldn't put up any rules at all besides maybe "keep it civil" and "try not to abuse mentions". The people here seem to have common sense enough to know if something crosses a line



a valid point, Have never had a problem yet



Yeah I think if the server ever gets huge, like hundreds of people, it might be worth it to cover our bases, but right now it seems pretty unnecessary



GurTrainer would be a good link to add right?
As well as an explanation that 3.0 is NEVER valid for runs



Yeah information like that would be great to put up there



Yo



I read the rules on the welcome page



And



Avoid off-topic? Seriously? ;-;



Yeah, it's being redone lol



Updated welcome, prolly still things that needs to be fixed but did a lil



Looks so much better!



Fuck, maybe I should have how to run TAS as a Q&A as well



Yo, now that's a good welcome page :D



Is the server's pfp at lvl 6 or 13? Or this pattern appears in various levels?



good ass message



it looks like level 6



Yeah



But also like 13



3:29



@Towny missed it by a frame

towny left stream right before



i hope he pbs that mile

thanks for le congrats



noice



damn a lot of time loss too



does towny slide actually save that much time



or 22 wk



no lmao



that towny slide saved like .2 at most



22 wk prob saved around 1.6



yea but in general



in general saves .5



i didnt know 22 wk saved thaat much



well if u do the ceiling bounce it saves that much



the other way saves a little more than a second



32 saves 2 full seconds though



yeah im doing 32 wk now



my 1-10 is so ass



yea my 21-30 was easily my worst section that run



my avg is like 28.2



whats you 1:10 pb cyclows



at the end of the day 1-10 doesn't mean shit



like 27.4



how do u even setup the towny slide



i cant get the grapple long enough



its very easy



just the timing



thats tough



but the setup is basically



setup takes some practice



it's easiest to do the slam dunnk



and re-grapple as soon as u hit the platform



also when u hit the plat make sure you're just holding down and not left/right



oh the timing isnt bad



grapple doesnt need to be as long as i thought



no, its a cool trick



yea towny slide is easy as shit



nvm



yup



how does 22wk work



do u have to manually jump



cant say much about wks lol



i dont know how to do them



i can get it off of the ceiling but its not very fast



and i casn get it off the wall but i cant jump off the bloc kfast enough



what do u mean u can get it off the ceiling but not very fast



do u make it to  the right side



yea



but i cant set it up consistently



like the time i take to set it up outweighs the benefits kinda



well the setup is just turnaround into jump



and i guess walk forward for a small amt at the start of the lvl



then turnaround jump



someone order a fat pb

A little to many but whatever
2 of them are removable



I maen got 2 admins and 1 temp



i don't even have src mod anymore jeez



oops, sorry



LUL



Yeah I think some of the roles are useful like SRC mod. But I think we could combine all the TAS roles into one



and maybe prioritize which ones are actually shown on the right



but I actually like the idea of many roles



as long as they arent crowding the sidebar



tas :LELW:



I think 2 TAS is good though, one self role and one if you're on the sheet



Think there's 6 sidebars
Owner
Admin
Speedrunner
TAS
SRC
LEGEND



oh 7, one for people that's just here as support as well

@merpell whenever you wanna verify it 🙂



i have to work up the motivation first



PauseChamp



KEKWait



TAS roles should be:  TAS author and TAS contributor



just these two, so it aint crowded, what do yall think



There should also be a Human TAS role for sub 2 hard mode >:D



make it sub 2:01



Nah I'm good with sub 2

{Reactions}
YEPsad (2) 


>:D



I have faith that you'll beat me @merpell



i dont



hard sub-2 gang aint a bad ide



And I'll be too burnt out to take it back



idea*



but first we need to clear some roles



It's not actually a great idea.



I don't think we should be super elitist



yea tbh



i agree



I don't actually care about a sub 2 role



i think our roles should prob decrease

{Reactions}
✅ (2) 


I  just want to cast some sick burns



I'm good with keeping ABSOLUTE LEGEND though



who wouldnt lol



> i think our roles should prob decrease
@rtdrtd67 agreed



I think ❤chatter can go and trusted can be replaced
Legend can get away from the side but i don't dislike it one bit

Otherwise I like when we at least put who's a speedrunner so not everyone is just a no-role



trusted could be replaced with which one?



but chatter could go yep



I maen why do we neeed a trusted?
We got mods right, and doggo does shit to but I guess TAS could get if he really want it



chatter is really just there so people have a role, so yeah

I don't have a problem with a lot of roles. but when one person have 10 roles that could be messy



from what I can remember trusted is a thing cuz some time ago anyone could modify everything in the server, and we saw how dangerous this could be, but i think @Doggo  said some people were trusted and could still have the permissions to modify things, so it gave trusted to some of us



^



hm, okay I mean I see the point.
As I said I don't dislike a lot of roles as long as they're not on one person. and people with a trusted role often don't have many others. It's basically the Admins that have a lot of roles so one of those I think can go



Okay if chatter were to be removed and tournament as soon as that's over and one Admin role. The it's like rtd in my opinion that's over the top on roles

Can't we just vote which ones should go?
There is Icons for all roles so just react with the Icon you want gone, should work right

{Reactions}
❤️ 


the second administrator role



idk why it exists



owner too



👑Actual World Record Holder👑 too



I just liked the hierarchy and icons on roles
Up for removing both tho



lol



think IL WR should go before actual wr



forgot about that one



yeah its funnier



And imo we should remove the emojis on the roles names

{Reactions}
☑️ ❌ 


But that's a "polemic" thing, some like it other not



Let's see what people think abouf



Amazing. Trump has 50%+ of the votes, but Biden has twice as many electoral votes



well i think that's because news ppl r confirming lots of states for biden



cuz cali/washington/oregon votes arent in yet



but theyre confirmed



p sure states like  florida and NC are locks for trump at this point but haven't been confirmed



WA is in already



florida ohio and nc cant not be trump now yeah



looks like pennsylvania is still biden-possible



pa will be biden



POLITICS IN GUR DISCORD :LELW:



WOO PPOLITICS



Poly-ticks



wisconsin looks most plausible to flip i think



but idk what im talkign about



Sorry for bringing up politics 😅



# general extends to all areas of life



I mean this could also go in #live



no ?



Live update! Trump wins!



That sort of "live"



That was a joke. Just in case you couldn't tell.



Text is a horrible medium for sarcasm



> # general extends to all areas of life
@rtdrtd67 all of them



Literally everything



#general got u



POLITICS 👀 👀 👀



if biden loses nevada wisconsin or maine hes fucked i think



and even then he needs to flip another state



could lose maine if he gets pa



Biden is pretty much fucked



nah a lot of the states that arent won yet need to count mail ins



which are dem favored



idt hes fucked but his chances are lower than i expected



Yeah



oh wait panthers here



crowds gathering in seattle :monkaS:



?



it was nice knowing you



didnt washington declare dem immediately



It's to be expected



whatre the crowds for then lol



when trump wins lel



KEKW



oh fair



na biden will still win



not by as much as i thought tho



polls were more shit than expected



:YEP: doubt



well we'll see



What were you saying about crowds gathering?



Board up them windows. It's civil war time



:POGGERS:



:pogu:



how the fuck is the ny % closer than pa rn

all good tysm



yw



i got so confused because you changed it on src too



so i thought some fishy shit was going on



lol



lol



who's winning by now?



i  checked some sites and its varying a lot



o damn biden took lead in michigan and wisconsin



he can win if he gets nevada, wisconsin, michigan, and arizona



looks like georgia is likely for Biden to win as well



seeing from the brazil side, biden is very bad for us, cuz he said about the amazon rainforest and that's going to put (idk  the right verb to use with the word sanctions) sanctions



and that's going to be very bad for us, higher taxes coming from US products and all



he has arizona



some sites havent called it yet



but most have



but yeah nevada + wisconsin + any other state wins even if he doesnt get michigan



if he gets nc he would also need me2 for it to not tie



but hes not gonna get nc lol



yo, did we do something about making GUR an official release?



merpell made a forum post about it, and last I remember the guy said it couldn't be an official release because it's marked as a webgame. So merpell asked if they could remove the webgame tag, and it seems like they kind of blew him off



What's the difference if a game is a webgame or not???



oof



its still an official game



if servers are considered official games



JSTRIS is considered an official game



Duck life is considered an official game



YO WTF

but



yeah but it's not tagged as a "webgame"



that's "web"
not "webgame"



o



if we change that they still wont accept i think so



ill ask again



use the duck life argument



and i dont get it the webgame thing yet, is this a thing that we need to put on our game? or can be discarted?



im not too sure how it works but the tag isn't necessary



so why dont we just take it off?



that's what we're trying to do



when merpell asked them to remove it, they sort of ignored him



whew.

wait this isn't #tournament



But I'm going to make a separate voice channel for it



I'm gonna try to make it so people are auto-muted when they enter, so people who aren't running/commentating can join and watch



3:30 est wtf

Maybe....

Otherwise I'd be here for the next one and Prolly jump in once in a while to see how it's going. Just letting you guys know



Oh I'm orange wtf
That's cool



You know, I'll probably just cap the channel at 3 so no one can join, but stream it on twitch so everyone can watch



or 4 if someone wants to co-commentate



im happy to co-commentate any games im not playing



:POGGERS:



you gonna be awake?



i know 3:30 is really early for you



well it would be like 1:30 for you



kekw



its 2:30 for me



i might not get there in time lol



wait, its 2:3o for you rn?



3:30 rn



ahhhh



gotcha



i could be ready at like 2:45



even i then i dont have to commentate every match not a big deal



2:45 my time or yours?



mine sorry



gotcha



we'll see how it goes



but it's only 1 race happening



kk



unless anyone else wants to schedule that day



why not have multiple



whole scheduling thing just for 5 min of gameplay



:POGGERS:



You're right though, it's all gonna be pretty short



shit man, maybe we should do bo3



i think the cubing ao5 format could be cool



take 5 times and drop the low and the high and the person with the best average of the remaining 3 wins



but that isnt really a race format



just a better average



so idk



but for races bo3 or even bo5 seems better than one race



I'm thinking either bo3, or just first person to win 2 races



isnt that just bo3 said twice



yeah



ok



i thought you were joking



but wasnt 100%



No lol, I meant them to be the same



just incase someone didn't know what bo3 means



for the finals maybe bo5 or bo7



bo7 :omegalul:



bo3 finals is wack



i agree bo3 finals



yep



bo3 is a good idea



but i dont think I'll be able to race friday



3:30 for me is 1:30



i mean 3:30 fri is just hetheis and csercser



lycro u should decide w/ doggo when u two can race



oh ºoº



didnt know that



so @Doggo I'm free all weekend, but i almost always go out or either Saturday or Sunday, so if you're free on both days of the weekend we can find a time with no problems



sorry for the not so precise schedule



its a part of living with your parents, you never know if you're going to go out



yeah i should be fine all weekend



okok so, thats good! What about 8:00 pm est?



which day



on saturday or sunday, idk which one I'm going to go out (if I'm going to)



ok either works



sorry for not being much precise



didnt you know doggo



lycro slays his women on the weekends



he needs some flexibility



or his men im not one to judge



why not both? :POGGERS:

{Reactions}
😳 


ya know how it works bro, da women (one hundo percent real ones) need ma flexibility



so you guys on for sunday?



my race?



ya



probably saturday, but MAYBE on sunday



both at 8:00 pm est



alright just lemme know when you figure it out



bro, I only figure out at the day, my mom never tells me if we're going to go out, I'll ask her, but she ain't much reliable



but its 90% sure we're going to race saturday



again: sorry for not being precise

that being said i dont think anyone has ever had the mental fortitude to get to level 6 on that shit game



its not a bad game



but it's not give up robot 1



its not a good one poggers



nah im messin around



its alright its just not for me



it just doesnt do it for me like the original \;))



its not as good as gur1



ufo levels suck balls



YES



rockets suck



the ufo levels suck



those are the worst



coins feel so out of place



but it opens up possibility of a painful 100% run



is it possible?



probably



i feel like there's some levels where you cant get every single coin



ufo levels for instance



i guess you could die intentionally



then why do they even exist



why not?



visual clutter



i guess it highlights important stuff



they just feel odd



like I'm obligated to get them



definitely fixed that conundrum in celeste with the strawberries

:POGGERS: LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO



nevada



results



are about to be in



no they rnt



not full results



but more ballots



they said theyd drop all the ballots theyve counted at 9 pm and its 9 pm



they went back on that



oh are you fucking kidding me



biden wins ga pa nv az is my prediction



i dont think he wins ga anymore



gap is 40k votes and narrowing with 5% left in heavy dem counties



he wins ga



it says theres 2% left for me



with the same gap



idk then



probably goes to recount



def



what the actual fuck is taking nevada so long though



they were slow as hell at the start of election night too



they're getting the aliens in area 51 to vote



takes a while



didnt put any votes out til like an hour after all their ballots closed



and they had to extend some of thier ballots an extra hour



I demand a recount for WA. My ballot hasn't been counted yet



it wasnt counted after midnight so its not valid



did you mail in your ballot?



if so, it's in the puget sound rn



Nah, put it in a drop box



But my signature was invalid so I had to sign a form

fuck nevada btw



I think we should advertise the marathon in the SRC discord
I know it's pretty soon but haven't thought of it before



marathon?



oh fuq
I mean the tournament



oops



yeah that's a good idea, would they be okay with that?



Yeah, I think so at least
I'm not a member rn but think i remember that they have one event thing and one speedrunning channel. Think both are okay to ask people or advertise or something like that



Worth to check out though



in order to do wallkicks I need to change direction after or at the same time i press X and Z?



and do i need to have uparrow pressed?



In practice the easiest wallkicks are just holding up



You only need to start holding right/left a decent amt of time after you leave the wall



Or maybe not a decent amt of time if you hit the ground quickly



i cant hit even one wk



this shit is hard af



was trying it just for fun



we need a tutorial video on it



I’ll look into making one



NOICE



what are your bets on tomorrow's match?



hetheis and cser are very neck to neck



@Towny any bets?



cser will win



hmmmm



idk yet, both of them are very good an close



hes more recently active, so less rusty



hes been grindin lately



yeah, but hetheis have more time/experience running



true, true



may that helps him not getting in the nerves



but it will be a great match



that I'm sure



for sure



but cser is on fire rn, so he'll be very sharp



I'm sitting on the fence rn



What time is the tourney?



3:30 PM EST



or EDT whichever one it is

Let's just say ET

idk why the pb times have height markings but the layout looks good



that's an acceptable timing format



looks pretty :POGGERS:



looking good



> that's an acceptable timing format
@Towny just like controller is an acceptable control scheme



maybe i should change it, I'm just going off mario kart 64 display lmao



classic towny living life like it's 1996



I was 1 😦



oh cause mario kart came out in 1996



I could have sworn most races used apostophes



but after looking it up I think it's probably just mario kart lol



maybe add a discord capture for the vc to show who's talking



^^



That's a good idea



that's what all the cool streamers do



anyone free to hop in the tourney chat so I can crop the videos and stuff beforehand?



yea i can



I may or may not have pb'ed by 20 seconds twice in a row



ez



still bad but ez



nice!



you mean you pb'ed 20 sec and then more 20 secs again?



equaling 40?



40 sec improvment

Yup, full at work with that one

Don't excpect something though



©️ 2020 by Give up robot.



YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LEVEL CREATOR COMING SOON



LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



I sure hope so, I got some ideas for some levels



but yo, the site is awesome by now



49 but it's double the distance

with time we can improve it



48 but it doesnt exists

that would be cool ngl



> 49 but it's double the distance
@merpell the same with 24 but vertically



god no wtf



EKKEKEEKEKE



I would like it



someone already made that



I think it was cyclowns



he made an insanely long 24



KEEKEKEK GENIUS



HSG stalling



lvl 22 but everything but the lava are spinners



or everything but the floor be spinners idk



kek



Oops! All spinners



YOOOOOOOO



lvl 42 but way, WAY tighter



42 but grapple is disabled



ez merpell dub

{Reactions}
🤝 


i dont use grapple on 42 too lol



lvl 31 and/or 37 but it have some challenging turns



I'd love that



yo @SensualPudding I know its still early to ask, but will the code to make levels be easy to mess with?



I really would like to create lvls



The level codes are basically just xml so very easy to understand
Example for L11
```xml
<level>
  <width>320</width>
  <height>240</height>
  <solids>
    <rect x="0" y="192" w="32" h="48"/>
    <rect x="288" y="192" w="32" h="48"/>
  </solids>
  <objects>
    <fallingPlat x="72" y="192" width="32" height="32"/>
    <player x="8" y="184"/>
    <fallingPlat x="144" y="192" width="32" height="32"/>
    <fallingPlat x="216" y="192" width="32" height="32"/>
  </objects>
</level>
```

But i'll try to make a level creator so you don't have to mess with the code at all
Might take a few weeks for me because I have no real experiense and little time but I'll do my best



that doesnt look too bad tbh



No it's really easy



I'm just unfamiliar with decompiling swf files



which i could learn pretty easily



so with the x and y location is that the location of the bottomleft most pixel or what?



this code looks very easy



LETSGOOOOOOO



the x and y of the falling platforms are their center?



I'd assume it starts at the top left but don't really know



oh



guess we'll find out at some point 🙂



what program do you guys use to decomp the swf?



7zip Kappa



not funny



cried

{Reactions}
YEPsad 


i dont even mess with that 😎 👍



you cant go wrong if you dont attempt it



:6head:



but im very hyped for messing with the code to create levels



a lvl creator interface would be cool, but i think that would be very hard for sensual to do



Either way I think I'll have to do a custom GUR because it's really fucking inpractical to recompile the program every time



lol i imagine the pain



> what program do you guys use to decomp the swf?
@Towny The source is up on the website for download if you wanna



yo I was watching yesterday race, and congrats @Vicckeey , but I wanted to know, what is considered a lycro 29? as you guys called vicckeey 29 on the first match



when you constantly hold down during the grapples



at least for me i never hold down



ooooooooooh



yeah, thats definitely slower, but when I started running I struggled so much in 29 that i kinda made this "strat"



i have to stop doing that lol



its consistent in races tho

Give me all your mind runes



daaaamn rc lvl?



100



That's almost enough mind runes to get to 200m XP



Do you still play? @Towny



I'm assuming you have played since you recognized that pic



i play osrs sometimes



you can add me, it's "Iron Towny"



I started an ironman account a couple years ago, it's all I really still play



fo sho



i used to play this webgame called gates of survival that was basically runescape but an idle game



it was fun and had a good community but the dev sucked



he would remove useful features because people made him mad



by complaining about balance or whatever



if 50 was way easier



would that make gur a better or worse speed game and by how much



worse



it would be way too easy to pb



hard to say



and not hype at all



i like 50s difficulty



if it was easier the game would be more about small optimizations which can get boring



i was thinking worse bc without 50 the game is a whole lot easier, which would make wr tighter and more optimized i guess?



makes it hype too



yeah, look at SMB1



hype is good but backloaded difficulty can be annoying



os smb1 difficulty backloaded



or frontloaded



no, it's just easy the whole way through



so it's really optimized



wait what



world records are ms apart



isnt that the game with a lot of frame perfect tricks



i dont think smb1 is easy



only a few



its got the bullet bill thing



and the wall jump



and some clips



right



and the weird thing with the warp pipe



yup



where you have to walk to the right pixel



its hard to get wr, but it's easy to get within a couple seconds of it



well not easy



but you know



conceptually easy



it's not as hard as gur 50



not executionally



like you know what you have to do to get 5 seconds off wr but the executipn is still hard



nahhh i could do it in like a month easy



🤔



5 seconds off wr is like 200th place



that's how optimized the game is



i mean most smb1 optimization comes more from game knowledge than movement



which i think also contributes to it being uninteresting



relative to other speedgames of the same caliber



yea smb1 is the perfect example of an easy speedgame getting optimized to hell and back until you need 5000 resets to pb



ye and i think a lot of that is because of how simple the movement is



which makes me think gur with easy 50 wouldnt be comparable



you can lose small amounts of time to stuff thats basically out of your control bc of how grapple movement works (see: 20, 48)



and the skill ceiling for optimal movement is still extremely far from reach without most of it being blatantly tas-only like in smb1



i wouldn't want 50 to be super duper easy but i think the massive difficulty jump at the very end at all skill levels hurts the accessibility of gur



48 is still worse though



Yo, I agree with 50 being good for the game, I think it makes the skill ceiling higher and have a little hype at the end



But about smb1



It's not that the game is easy, he's fucking 35 years old, it WILL be optimized, there's no way to avoid it, and being one of the most famous (if not the most) famous franchise of all time only helps to that



You could say it's easy to learn, but hard to master



If you compare smb1 popularity with gur for example, the times will change, but, for example



Getting a sub 5 on smb1 is relatively "easy" (not at all lol) but getting a 4:55 is hard af 
In GUR getting a sub 4 is relatively "easy" (again not super easy) but getting a sub 3:30 is not



But that's all because the popularity of the game



The more popular the game is, more people to optimize it



If GUR was 25 years older and was as popular as smb1 the times would be as tight as their

install select?



woops, copied the wrong thing



No bug fixes, probably only a basic level installer. then a builder is next



youre a god damn legend for this btw



also i feel like the only levels that even remotely hurt gur as a speedgame are 46 48 50 and autoscrollers



autoscrollers far more than the other 3



why 46



turnaround grapple has bad controls



or ur just bad



i dont have a problem with it anymore but i did for most of the time where i was bad



i wonder if it would be better with an input buffer or something



it would



but im not sure how that would be implemented



since the grapple comes out frame 1



and can grapple stuff frame 2



if during the first like 3 frames of a grapple you could press the opposite direction and the grapple would snap to that direction



itd be nice



but we know how badly this game handles the grapple snapping to places



43 hsg is fun



YOOOOOOO GUR TRAINER 4.0 LETS GOOOOOOO



is it going to have segments?



like 1-10 times 11-20 and etc?



hyped af



whens 4.0 projected to be finished? Also the level injector would be great, I could start working on my kaizo levels



probably a day or 2 for the level functions but if you'll want me to fix some bugs etc. it'll take longer
Could release a 4.0 beta with only the level installer first



Anyone interested in playing Among Us?



you talkin about just in this server?



Yeh



o yea i'd be interested



not sure if we can get 10 ppl at once tho



So I have 3 people already



We could do it with 5



I'd be down but not tonight cause I gotta be up early tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow after the tourney or something? I got some people too I could invite



@rtyou down for a 5 person?

no cap?



holy shit nice



i was pixels away from death in the last room



but it made for a good thumbnail



i got a 30 death farewell earlier today



still need to learn power source skip or w/e with the jellyvator



but i wanna go for farewell gold before any of the other golds i need cuz its my favorite level



is actually your first gold?



no chapter one or anything



bc that would be really cool



jellyvator + power source skip is a necessity



it saves like 2 minutes i think



and youll be dying after power source a lot, so it saves hours in the long run



na i have every gold up to reflection a/b



just got bored there because i dont like reflection a



and farewell is my favorite chapter



cuz its actually difficult



fw is fun the first 30 hours of learning the gold but you might enjoy it longer than i did



but yeah skipping to fw gold would be cool



do it



whoaa you did fw gold



good job



yoooo congrats on the gold klice



fw is hard af



i got a  13 death fw run in february i think



but i got bored of the level very quickly and  never really came back



@Klice Grats on FW!



@Towny I crashed the price of earth runes down to 1gp each by selling a chunk of my stack

yo im tryna get a lobby together for among us tonight in a few hours, dm me for an invite if you wanna play 🙂



So I just discovered a potential faster strat for 45



:0



:pogu:



RTA viable?



Maybe?



HSG at the start to get on top of the block



YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



wait wut



we've done that before, right?



yea we have



the problem is the last corridor



like getting through the last gap



You can HSG with enough speed to get up to the last corridor ya



yup, getting passed the gap is the part we haven't figured out



even with TAS?



yeah even with TAS, it seems impossible



but who knows



damn boe



Well I think with TAS it could be done



I'm less optimistic about it



Cause can't you get a little bit of a horizontal boost by tapping up the frame before you release a swing?



45 TIME SAVE :KEKW:

{Reactions}
KEKW 


So couldn't one theoretically do that repeatedly to clib a wall?



i would love one tho



>clib



What's the WR on 45?



yeah it's getting enough vertical height thats the problem. I don't understand the "bounce" well enough to say it's impossible though



Errrm I meant vertical boost



if that works id be genuinely surprised

delete system 32



ahh k thx



and dont forget to download keygenerator.exe



no go to merpell > appdata > roaming > GURTRAINER > Local Store > TAS > L



smash that like button



paste the file in, delete the second underscore in the file name



dont forget to subscribe



make sure it's the lowest time



then open gurtrainer 3.0 and press T on the level



sensual wrote a guide on #tas



on how to run tas files



I'm so sorry @Towny



nah it was pretty funny



just walking right in the pit



made me lol



after my awful showing of my consistency in 50 in the race



im currently doing what any logical person would do

most of that timesave is from launching with the spinner



which i probably wont do in races or real runs



for a while



im not *that* inconsistent at it though

That's how the files will look
NOTE: the "name="_'name'_"" is what the level will be called once installed



and here i was about to sleep tonight



Towny slide on a horizontally scrolling 40?



here's an example level
Just normal L10 but so you know how it's formatted and named and everything

Don't know if a .bin is a must but I did it every time



let me dig around for Long 24



The installed levels can be found at the same place as the TASes but under "assets"
note you CAN NOT directly drop files there, you need to install them from the program



> Towny slide on a horizontally scrolling 40?
wait would that work actually



if a platform were pushing you left and you were under a ceiling



could you hsg if you hugged the ceiling and let go as soon as it pushes you off



i dont think theres any base level you could test that on



here are all the levels bin files from the decomp btw, if you want to dissect any levels in particular

i doubt my brain is big enough for this



its literally just human readable xml



takes ages and a lot of testing to make something good though
I can't seem to work out the editor so I'm afraid you'll have to stick with it

I mean unless someoone here knows some js etc



@MaistlinRajere worked with that right?



i got into making an editor but just burn out



other projects i wanted to work on



would have taken too much effort



yeah understandable
A real pain



Some info about the trainer: it seems that 1 block is 8x8 pixels. All dimensions of rectangles need to be divisible by 8 or it'll round down... or up idk



I guess thats more info on the level creation



also the trainer needs to be closed and reopened if you plan on overwriting a level file



also each rectangles starts counting from the top left. So keep that in mind when coordinating the position



heres my first level. It's a wallkick simulator

Must do wallkicks to get to the end



and okay guys, according to the game code, the spinners are actually called "saws"



this has been known



saws :omegalul:

this is groundbreaking guys



we can no longer call them spinners

in reference to wallkicks



not even 1 :omegalul:



not even 25 :omegalul:



imagine thinking any level is safe from wallkicks



I do 22 and 34 rta



he did list 20



which is still safe



not once we implement the beginning wallkick



just no one wants to do it lol



2 8 10 11 12 15 16 17 19 20 24 26 27 30 33 35 40 41 47



are all of the safe levels i think



Wait on 20 can u wallkick and grapple the right side of middle block



Then right wall then ceiling?



im blanking



what would you wk off of



The ceiling at the start



oh true



Wait u don’t even need the middle block huh



Just straight to right wall?



Or is it too low



i think even the top of the right wall is too low



the exit takes off like a third of it

Really?



Yeh



If the TAS would fking work I could see what the TAS does



where did you save time?



Can always check the yt vid if the TAS is tough



At the end



Does anyone have the file for 39?



HSG at the end



Don't have it right now



But the TAS does a wk at the end I think



I found it. Forgot it's in the sheet



Yeh



I found a RTA viable timesave



Theoretically, the HSG could be faster?



You can get through the gap a frame or two faster



HSG launches you at the same speed as wk right?



I mean maybe
HSG would launch you the exact frame you can fit through the gap I guess
Plus not needing the extra jup and Z thing
Maybe a lil faster but I actually don't know



Yeah exactly



I'm trying it out now



I got a 16.4



And I don't think I did it optimlally



YAS



16.30



Finally, I'm a TAS author 😄



There's like a couple frames tops of improvable time

Did you climb normally or successfully did a HSG on the 23?



Climbed it. I'm not sure you can get enough height for an HSG



> Is sub 1:00 1-20 good?
@MaistlinRajere yep, a 55 seconds average is a close wr pace



1:00 is awesome tho



O.o



1:00 usually means i died



0:57 isnt good but definitely not reset worthy



I reset everything above 56.8



i have gotten a single  sub 1



i think ive gotten 0:53 like



once



definitely not more than twice



I probably just got the slowest 0 death run with fast 50



3:58.35

WELCOME TO THE SUB 4 CLUB



THE YEAR OF CSER

congrats mate



I was pretending to be in the second race against rtd and hetheis



you won the tourney then :pogu:



THE REAL WINNER IS CSER



that is basically what I'm saying



damn gg i thought that was a meme



did you record



yeah



so pissed



did a random couple runs

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/777293399165239296/unknown.png



would have been sub 3:40 but i died at the end of 50 AGAIN



after getting the hsg



i've been cucked out of 3:3x by grapple physics on the same spot on the same level twice



ive had to have been cucked out of 3:3x at least a dozen times by 50



at this point



legit had a run that would have been 3:34 or 3:33 die to 50 hsg



expected from cyclown circus



my bikes are fucked



cyclowns reclaims wr??



i sincerely doubt



i want a good looking ball back at least



Rip, I just got a ~~1:39.95~~. It would have been a PB if I didn't lose 3.5 seconds to a death on 49



1:39.95 on lvl 30?



Sorry 3:59.95



I don't know where I got that number



the sub 4s are raining



+0.28 over my PB

building that 50 consistency?



yeah

about time



that i got a decent run



GG :)



2 second loss death on 30, some minor timeloss on 32, 43, 46, 50



i am happy now



oohhhh



ez @Towny bop



i kind of want my :LGBallT: back but i dont think im consistent enough at 22wk



to go for it



22 wk is def not a necessity for wr



i would need super optimized movement to get 3:2x without it



i feel like



I mean I'm super close with a bad 22



Only 1wk and bad 50



maybe



i can save 4 secs alone just by not dying and having a better 50



swinging past the last row in 29 saves more time anyway



on my current run



then maybe 2 secs save from a 1st try 32wk (i got it 2nd try), towny slide, faster 34, better 1-20?



well my sob is a 3:21.64 and it's still def not optimal



without 22 wk would be a 3:23



ill go for runs without 22wk and if its just too hard to get good pace then ill try grinding it maybe



my 1-40 was 2:26.35



which is not very good



yea even w/out 22 wk sub 2:20 lvl 40 is possible



evidently

why do ppl do 29 by like



going past the lava and then grappling over it



ive tried it for like 5 minutes and its always .5 slower than the way i do it



and its harder



but that part is probably jsut me



what's ur avg 29 time



like 6.3 or 6.4



i think



yea it's like .2 or .3 slower if u do first section in 3 grapples



else it's the same if 2 grappleps



> going past the lava and then grappling over it
@cyclowns this guy knows what's up



i do it the maistlin way



the only right way



that's the maistlin way?



yea theres like a 10 yr old video of him doing it that way



just found a more consistent way to do i t



i use the visual cue of like



grappling 3-4 lava blocks in



then going around



and it works pretty mcuh every time




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/777652726871752794/unknown.png



onyl way it dies is if i release too late and hit the lava's floppy dick

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/777652872841658378/unknown.png



i was experimenting with the long grapple under the lava at the end and it's actually possible



wait like avoiding the moving block?



yea



it's inconsistent to get in one swing though



so usually you have to grapple again and barely save time



basically you wanna hit right and grapple as soon as you touch the moving block



and that should get you a ceiling grapple



or a bit before you land on the moving block that is



oh wow that is possible



is that faster for TAS



i imagine it is



yea it's done in TAS



its wayy faster in tas



im pretty sure it saves more time from the first draft than everything else combined



wait no thats bs



but its like 1/5 of the timesave from the first draft alone



saves ~.7 on avg for me if one swing



like nothing to .2 seconds if i have to grapplep again



saves l ike .3 for 2 grapples



for me



yea i've beaten towny's IL dozens of time now



i think my best time was 5.52



i havent gotten it in 1 swing yet



it's rng dw



@merpell verify my run coward



unless you have things to do then take your time



@cyclowns Good job on the PB!



ill verify it before the pm turns to am have no fear

my gf is like show me proof nerd
i pull up the video and see a comment that says "wow 2 wrs in a week this game is alive" and i go "huh theres only been one"

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HOW DO I STOP GETTING UHSG'S ON LVL 29



FUCK NEW STRAT

im not going for that 29 strat



too ass



unintentional



lol



when you get stuck on the wall



oh i hate that



gets me on 36 sometimes



roboglue



i hate that



on 36 its just grappling later, but idk how to avoid it on thius new 29



grapple closer to thr moving block



make sure u start moving away from the wall as you  grapple



roboglue is the reason people do the other 29 strat btw cyclowns



cuz if i grapple closer i die on the lava



its the reason i do it at least



i almost never get roboglue the way i do it



you guys are calling this roboglue?

very bad run still



7 deaths



SLOW AF 50



but new pb yay



reaching lvl 50 in 3:39 is sub4 pace right?



depending on how fast you can do 50 anything lower than a 3:48 is sub-4 pace



but of course it depends how fast you can do 50



my average is 16 seconds in runs cause i go a little slower to not fail



so it was a possible sub4 YAHOOOOOOO



im happy:)



And yo @csercser3 congrats on the sub-4 ^^ forgot to say it at the day



Thank you, and congrats on your PB



brooo I cannot believe I missed a lycro stream



congrats on the pb though!

Then, I was 9.5 seconds ahead at 40 with 4 minutes left

On the membrane too



Its strange that before having a mechanical keyboard I always thought that it was a waste of money, but after buying one through recomendations, using membrane feels so strange



It's like there's no feedback I pressed the key

???



You don't notice anything off about it?



no i get whats off



im confused as to how the fuck you did it



🙂



you cant go in between the falling walls and the floor right



Can you though?



if you can that would probably save time in 16



_Can you?!?!?!_



:KEKW:



I shan't reveal my secrets



Did you HSG of the pillar and the right side floor?



I HSGed off of your mom



> I shan't reveal my secrets
@MaistlinRajere 
Did I fucking stutter?



Or you just made a custom level



I thought about doing that to start with the robot over there just to confuse everyone



So that all the falling blocks were still in place



But no, I didn't create a level



Then it must be HSG

if you fit through that small hole RTA I'm surprised



Which small hole

Is it possible to wk off of the last square instead of the way the TAS does it?



Is there any way to do an upwards HSG off of the same block you're grappling?



yeah



see towny slide



Sorry, I meant upwards



Yeah the idea would be the same
Though You can't grapple on the same like...X coordinate as you want to HSG of
Need to get stuck somehow



So would need to grapple and HSG of opisite corners and have something forcing you away from the grapple corner



Fuck all of you nonbelievers



I win

wow



blockless?



SO MUCH room for improvement



Blockless, bitches



post it



I will



That should be sub 2:50 btw



I just need to watch that beauty again



I wouldn't be surprised if sub 15 is possible



btw the HSG is PERFECT



So this mean 45 has the potential to loose it's title as the slowest level?????

this is fantastic



And I know you won't believe me but that's RTA



definitely room for improvement



No it looks rta



Sub 15 definitely possible



that HSG is amazing



Technically not blockless



Landed on the block



I was scared I'd die and lose the TAS file for that HSG



I think the HSG must have been pixel perfect



around both corners



wk off of the block at the end should be possible



Oh shit!



Should be able to to both a wk in the beggining and one at the right lava wall to save a bunch of time



You could wk offf of the lava



to get to the last block



This is my new favorite level



calling all @🤖TAS contributor🤖 @deleted-role



this is a breakthrough



The wall clibs should also be improveable



Yeah it is a breakthrough



Is this the only vertical autoscroller?



Besides H10



Someone make a custom level that's just a wall of lava you have to climb :KEKW:



Does a wk kill your upwards momentum? e.g. If you HSG upward and are going super fast, can you wk to push off the wall and keep your upwards momentum?



not in #tas banned



bahahahaha



I just improved H10



HSG is the new wk. 0.05s improvement

Anyone know if the max falling speed is the same as the descending speed? (down when grappling)



Thing down grapple is a bit faster
It's done in 34 right?



maybe i'm wrong though



I think 34 is because the block falls faster



oh that's true



So it pushes you down



F



FUUUUU



I hit the wk at the start and cut the corner falling as closely as I could. Was set for an IL WR and this shit happened

@Kawaii You joined just in time to witness a new WR



how



how did he do it



how did he get passed 45 in 0 seconds



He didn't.



He took 25 seconds, but saved time on the other levels



:pogu:



The Towny slide on 49 helped get -25.2s



But did you use the new trick which saves 0.3 seconds on 11?

Level 45 Elevator Skip (New Give Up Robot TAS Strat)
Until today, elevator skip was only a joke tossed around the discord as this unattainable timesave. I admit at times I said it was impossible. But Maistlin Rajere showed that wall climbing without touching a wall was possible, and actually did the level RTA. We cleaned it up a...

We are pushing the TAS to new limits. 11 skip was more of a meme than 45, and we solved BOTH tonight. Is any level safe???

every single time on fastest times v1 has officially been broken



That one was so bad though
Like 3:34 segmented or something

Think I removed it when the sheet got popular and we started TASing



3:34 woulve been an amazing segment at the time you posted it though



my 50 were a 19:18:KEKW:



tbf no one did IL times so didn't know what were good and not
but 19:18



ok thats pretty bad



i like how almost the entire tas sheet is gold and then theres just 11-20



with only 11 and 14 gold



And 20 is my least favourite TAS level
It looks so boring



18 was made suuuuper early



im surprised no ones been able to optimize it



I think at least 16, 18 and 20 can be faster
but non of them are really fun to tas, mostly just optimizing movement slightly



though cser will probably do some of the 11-20 levels by accident when he goes for IL records like he's done with the other 2



true



true



oh also



i think the weird time difference that forced me to make a best-case and worst-case chart



is rounding



cus we found out recently that .x1 .x4 .x6 and .x9 are impossible



that being said i think the current tas time is *exactly* 2:43



21.82, 45.12, 1:13.65, 1:55.85, 2:43.00



what makes you think that?



1-10 is 21.81 which would round up to 21.82



41-50 is 47.14 which would round up to 47.15



Full TAS run vid when?



I found it to be if 0:00.%this here%
can round up it adds .16 otherwise it adds .15
I don't know what you mean



maybe its time for a new full tas run



Yea



due to the way gur converts and rounds frames to seconds times can’t end in .x1, .x4, .x6, or .x9



Aaa, understand now
Yeah it's different ideas but I think they work the same
Easier to script what I did I think, but don't knw if it would work every time, can't prove it but belive so



I don't know who wrote the first timer, but why do we use ROUND()
can I take it away because this is getting crazy long and need to make it a bit more readable for me if I wanna do this



After a lot of hair pulling and rewriting of formulas it finally works
The timer in the sheet now will calculate the exact time the TAS will do
Now the question is

Do you want to keep the theoretical time or we can scrap that??



no purpose



What I thought
Then I'll scrap it



There's 2 spaces between : and the times
Thats just in case we get a time without decimals so it won't fuck up
If anyone onely want one space you'll have to change a bit under the regexextract(), you're welcome to because I couldn't figure it out



did you run the tas files through your version btw



to make sure the times round right



Yup, the timings were correct
Didn't test different TASes but I think it works



Worst case senario it'll be like .02 wrong so no huge difference
And then I'll try to correct it



YOOOOOO CONGRATS ON 11 AND 45 SKIP!!!1!1!1!



11 is so sick



And how do you guys call the continuous vertical gain by grappling on 45?



stupid?



thats what i call it



I mean, it checks out



wallclimb i guess



It's a good name



everyones been calling it wallclimb yea



It's facisnating how we're still discovering things in a 2010 flash game



tbf this community has existed for like



at most a year



Yeah, but seeing that the game has only one big mechanic it's still very awesome how much dept there is to this mechanic



That's why we love GUR



unfortunately nothing we discover in this game will be as sick as dst skip in odyssey



Dst skip?



The dark side one?



no daylight savings time



basically there's a seed in sand kingdom



that you can plant



and it grows in i think 10 minutes



OOOOO



The seed one



so you can plant it, go into a sub area



That was cool af



You're right



and then you set your switch time up at the start of the run



so that when youre in the sub area fucking dst happens



and the game thinks an hour has passed when you leave



rip to odyssey speedrunners in arizona



i'll happily take not having dst



over being able to run odyssey



fair



imagine needing a vpn to speedrun a game because of dst

arcanod just posted a video for the first time in 5 years. He's alive!



should we try to contact him



post the TAS in the comments on his 4:06 run or somethin



what if he thinks



it is spam or something



makwe the comment: REAL TAS *insert link*



idk as long as we dont say CHECKOUT THIS LINK$$$FREE MONEY HERE GIVEUPROBOTTAS.COM$$$



make an alt with titty pfp named "HOT SEX IN ABOUT PAGE" and leave a normal comment



then put the tas link in the about page



LMAO



NO DOGGO THATS TOO GOOD



i never thought i would be alive during an arcanod upload



I mean we must do something right
Like someone should just tell him about to check out the leaderboards and ask him to join the discord or anything
Can't miss the opportunity



i left a comment on his 4:06



Joined the server.



Welcome welcome



ty ty <3



arcanod's src account was last online 5 days ago😳



who is he arcanod?



the guy who held the normal game wr for like 5 years before me



an he disappeared for?



2 years I think



that sounds interesting



yea arcanod got wr when hardly anyone cared about the game yet



it was mostly just wr because it was deathless



his strats were weird



well it was 7 years ago so no wonder I guess



hell everything has changed in the past few years



past ten months more like

monkagiga 


nah i kinda liked quotes better honestly



quotes are still around though so its chill



Idk, the reply is more organized imo



replies have their uses but theyre very bad rn



theyll probably get fleshed out but



Why are they bad? (Didn't use it until now)



quoting was bugg6



Idk her flaws rn, what are they?



buggy



Kind of



- ping by default, only way to disable it is a way that almost nobodys gonna bother with
- no visual difference between a ping and non-ping
- message links are fairly easy to click on accident and even if you click it on purpose theres no convenient way to go back to the message that had the reply link
- cant reply to sections of a message (as opposed to quoting)
- cant reply to messages in separate channels (as opposed to quoting)



i think the third one is the biggest issue



would make convos that overuse replying extremely chaotic to read back through



Oh, that makes sense



Yeah, but they have just been released, they will be improved by time



But yeah, some big flaws



doggo out here writing a masters thesis



hopefully they fix it but discord has a track record of not fixing certain obvious issues for extremely long amounts of time



see: role color picker on mobile



actually most of those issues just pertain to mobile



lol



Tbh almost everything on mobile sucks



role color picker, light mode fix, existence of compact mode, how easy it used to be to accidentally ping people by clicking their name



Or it's way worse than desktop



theres *one* upside to mobile that i dont think theyve fixed yet



I wish it wasn't this way ;-;



Which one?



if you have perms to change your nickname you can access the "manage user" menu on yourself



and that lets you see a servers entire rolelist



even if you dont have any other perms



Lol I've did this on my friend's server and he wondered how did I discovered the roles before everyone



So that's why



Cool to have a discord specialist on the server kek

I’m gernerouse



I cannot believe i fell for that



im better than that 😦



Haha



You got gnomed



Haa



I need to freaking know how that ceiling kick crap is being done or Imma loose my mind especially after watching that tas video coz I can't find it in the guides here or on the src website



and I tried it a lot but I can't seem to figure it out



its called a wallkick



hold up and grapple a wall or ceiling for exactly two frames



itll launch you in the opposite direction from what youre facing



2 frames ha .-.



easy to practice on 23 and 32



well I tried



never worked



yes I practiced those exactly



yea that's bcuz it's hard



You'll have to press the oposite direction of the wall the frame after those 2 frames



i don't think you have to on 23 or 32



I tried too ;-;



well if you want to cross the gap maybe but for the wallkick itself you only have to hold up



ah cool



and it's the same for when kicking a ceiling right?



yup



just hold up



and press grapple for exactly 2 frames



for ceiling wks its more important to remember that it launches you in the opposite direction though



yes I noticed that



thank you all



yall crazy <3



:+1:



w:omegalul:ll kicks



i wouldnt worry abt wallkicks in full runs for a while if i were you



theres only a few levels where the difficulty is worth the timesave even at top level



50 skip is probably the most important skip to learn, right after you feel comfortable wth the game



definitely



I played a game a lot but knew about these strats only yesterday



also I'm a little psycho I can get it fast but the problem is me not having any free time in the meantime



ah that's unfortunate



probably for the next 3 years :')



I'll be busy



yeah i wouldnt learn wall kicks for a while



for example i dont use them at all and i still get sub-4s pretty regularly



ofc if you're shooting for wr or even top 3 you'll need them



im not sure sensual did any



yeah I don't post anything if it wasn't the new wr to be honest



like hell he got a 3:30 with no wallkicks



he mightve done 32



im not positive



but idts



oh hi sensual



Though I got second place, a 3:30 without wk yea



nah it has 32



but thats still nuts



that its ONLY 32



32 means 32 wk in a full run?



Now yea, but my past pb didn't

Oh maybe that wasn't the 330



wallkick on the level 32 ye



ah yeah



32 wallkick saves a bunch and is super easy so its the most practical wk for full runs



it still saves some time even if you fuck up the wk twice



u have to fuck it up quickly tho



ofc



so the wk isn't much consistent?



yea well it varies from lvl to lvl



ceiling wks are generally a bit more difficult in my opinion



rtd still gets nightmares from 22 wks



i'm pretty sure i attempt the most wks per run besides maybe cser



yep



i die on 22 a lot



cser?



pretty sure cser does like double your wks in first 10 alone



true



1 wk



wait does he actually do 1 wk lmao



no i was kidding



figured



wouldn't be surprised if that got added soon tho



he does 5 and 6 wk



i will do 8 ihook in full runs one day



mark my words



that is



if you pb



:KEKW:



,,,true



of course im not one to talk about pbing



it ain't freaking working



I mean I do get kicked away from the wall but for only 2 pixels



release earlier then



idk



they're very difficult



I think I'm releasing at the right time



but idk about keeping the momentum



faaaak I did it



I have to spam jump?



nah just hold it if im not mistaken



but im no wallkick expert



I held it all the prev times



as soon as I tried spamming it worked



like i said im not an expert so im probably wrong



ty a lot anyway <3



I think I achieved my goal for today :3



feels cool



I think you are right about holding instead of spamming I was  just lucky



theres another way to do them that doesnt rely on the two frame window



but adds a one frame window



if you grapple a wall and press up on the same frame you release it'll also wk



so you mightve gotten that when you were spamming



yes I think ur right



It depends on how I'm feeling, but I normally wk on 5, 6 (if I mess up on 5), 23 at the beginning and end, 29, and 32 beginning and end (all of which I attempted in my PB)



damn not 22?



i might do 6 wk



I don't do any ceiling wks yet



i was trying that earlier and its not very hard and saves like .5



5 wk isnt bad either



22 is easily the hardest wk you can try



imo



idk the double wallkick in 34 is pretty fucking hard too



36 is also very hard



as is 43 lol



Im feeling generous

trying to refresh myself on 35 and 36



over my rta hiatus i became absolute dogshit at them



it is annoying



im still bad at 35



idk how you can fuck up 36 unless you're doing the dumb strat though



i am doing the dumb strat



the dumb strat that doesnt save time



it saves like .3



and only increases your chanc eof death by 10x



yea if you get a lucky grapple



if you get an unlucky grapple which is like 80% of the time it saves nothing



are we playing the same level



lucky grapple saves half a second



unlucky grapple saves .3



unlucky grapple 3.85
lucky grapple 3.55
normal level 3.78



just tested



oh youre just doing it slow as shit



you can get like 3.2x



my average is high 3.4x



when i get it



i got a 3.38 with lucky grapple



that was like 1 in 15 attempts though



its still not worth it



honestly its less worth it than most wallkicks



no one can argue that it looks cool though, so totally worth



challenge idea



do H3 without activating any falling blocks



is it possible



actually it is definitely possible



not as interesting as i thought



fun to actually attempt though



holy shit OBS saved me from almost becoming deaf



my pc was in max volume cuz my brother was using it, and i opened OBS without intending to, when i opened a video obs lowered it and it was fucking high



YO WHAT THE FUCK



i just did 7 wk RTA

k, now tie tas on 11



i wanna go for that trick because i think it would be funny to have a legit IL record on 11



but its way too precise



that would be very funny and cool at the same time



word record

i am done for today



Joined the server.



lettuce see who this is?



yo lettuce sup



YOOOOO NOW I GOT THE JOKE



sup



i think i may start doing 22wk



i didnt realize it saved like 1.5  sec



good luck



if you hit the wk like right at the corner its supa fast



for some reason



yup



TASers seeing this: WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN



tas already does it like that



its def already used



its just neat



cause if you go any higher you need to jump off the block and if you do a ceiling wk it doesnt reach far enough



ceiling reaches



just slower



trying to do 22 wk just feels like smashing my keyboard and hoping it works



sometimes



yea it does feel like that



especially when u fail it 5x in a row



yknow maybe im not gonna go for 22 wk



ill save that for if i wanna get like a 3:25 or something



yknow that sounds like a good idea



not sure if dropping would help me too



it might



you can still pb by a fair bit



didnt you have a death on like 41 or something



and 30



and 45 was slow



as was 21



o yea i can prob get like 3:26 or maybe 3:25



more than that seems too close to gold



are we starting to reach the limit



doubtful



yea probably not



a deathless run with 5/6wk, 22wk, 34 double wk



would be like the holy grail



i think one time i was streaming and lycro, towny, and i were talking about were we thought the time could go in 2 years



i think someone will find a consistent explanation for the bs grapple rng



3:1x will definitely happen eventually i think



and maybe wallclimb can be made more conssitent so elevator skip is a thing in rta



3:0x is doubtful



in 2 years probably a 3:15 is possible



if the community stays active



tbh if a new trick is discovered 3:0x is not impossible



yea for sure



we're running low on leads for skips though



that are RTA viable at least



yeah whats not done in the current wr



23 wk bc rtd fucked it up



but past that



does he do 34 wk



i mean



yea but he fucked up the second one



you could get an ultrafast 50



like 1 swing for the 2nd pillars



5 and 6 wk, 45 hsg, 50 last 3 pillars in one swing



that would be 3:1x



maybe 3:0x if elevator skip actually saves a lot of time if its made rta



lotta ifs



without elevator skip i think the limit with the tricks we have rn is a high 3:1x



or low 3:2x



if we figure out how grapple rng works you could probably get like 14 seconds on 45 rta



possibly



there's 36 wk



i tried for like 10 mins to get 36 wk rta



saves half a sec if good



and i kept getting phat ass wallkicks but i couldnt grab the block



oh yeah your run doesnt do the 29 either



o yea maybe time save on 29



1 swing



yea u gotta get used to the fat ones



so u react and press left



43 hsg/wk RTA when



it saves like .8



cant wait until hail mary 35 gets added



god no



we could also do faster 1



saves like .5 to a second



faster 1 isnt that bad yeah



if we want a 1-10 jail 8 ihook could be added too



'was only 26 sec 1-10 and not 25, reset'



thats probably what it wouldve looked like two years ago to see rtd reset on high 28s



yea i remember my old 4:00.35 WR



had like a 27.95



and it was the segment record and merpell was like 'holy shit that 1-10' i nthe comments



lmfao



now i get a 27.95 and im like ugh did i fuck up 7 or something



time to grind 1 wallkick



time to grind 25 wallkicks



plural



yeah there's three



four if you're swag



if u do the ihook there's 3



tas isnt swag



or u can replace the ihook w/ a 4th



ihook on 25 is not swag



4 wallkicks was way cooler



now that 11 skip is a thing you guys want a truly unimprovable le vel



17



i love how 34 has consistently gotten more swag throughout the entire making of the tas though



17 ihook incoming



how would an ihook even save time



magic



wsit what if you fucking ihook + wallkicked in 27 LOL



i doubt itd save time



clearly though you can improve 17 by aiming the grapple release toward the second spinner



then using up+z+s to triple jump off the spinner into the end



S TO JUMP WEIRDCHAMP



theory

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/779506655611453471/unknown.png



spinner is faster than terminal velocity



i think



yeah but swag



true



28 hsg, ihook, quintuple wallkick



can you hsg on 28



yes



hhsg off of the first block



the tas does it



oh lol you can



as of like three days ago



28 no spinner challenge



question



we never figured out why you cant run off of a moving platform did we



in the direction its moving at least



uhhh i dont think so



or why you can walk on the spinners in 22 precisely



well that ones intuitive



its just bc those are the only spinners adjacent to ground



yeah but we dont necessarily know the answer



because if you're on a falling platform and it falls onto spinners you also dont get hurt



wait where do you test that



also on 22



theres falling platforms right above the spinners



oh right im bad



and if you grapple something you instantly explode



i would guess that spinners were treated like solid ground initially



then matt realized you could stand on them



so they coded it so that landing on them killed you



but said code doesnt actually kick in if you stay grounded



is there a spinner thats next to you on ground



but not below you



that you can walk into



uhhhhhhh



idts



yea i cant think of any



well we always have level editing



yea



ill test that later thop



:+1:



we really have to figure out how ihook works to abuse it



i just randomly tried to do ihook on 7 and i had it send me in like 5 different directions



and idk why



we know how it works



> on the second frame of grappling a spinner the game corrects your grapple so that it's in the middle of the spinner
> so that you actually spin around it properly
> if you release on the same frame as that correction it launches you in the direction it tries to correct your grapple toward



neat



i just realized ive been losing 1-1.5sec on 45 for no reason



just cuz i havent changed how ive done it in 2 years



what were you doing wrong?



wasnt grabbing the 2nd moving block as fast as possible



or getting to the end from that block as fast as possible



oooooh



i used to do it slowly too



one more timesave letsgo



also i never jump into the 1st moving block



when i should cuz it saves a little bit



welp



i still have my signature pseudo-hsg on 45



lol



doing the setup for elevator skip at the start and then just not doing it?



yea



i did that before i even knew what hsg was



i just thought it was interesting



truly the only reason elevator skip was ever found



slam dunk 38 used to be my signature move...



i used to roll the dice



thats why you name your tricks after yourself



feel the fear in my enemy's eyes



so theyre always your signature move



@rtdrtd67 does rtd stand for roll the dice



take notes from towny



LOL i didnt even notice that



just had the thought



yeah, it does, on table RPG at least



the server i play on has this command



i thought aboust asking that to him but idk



yea rtd is a thing in some tf2 servers



Finally gave up gur for rsr4?

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



i thought you guys were updatjng both of them



cool to see we're using the official kekek



the TAS still on the sheeet tho?



Iupdated the on on the TAS page the other day, but the other one I don't do anything about



yeah, TAS us updated regulary



yo i discovered that the active players on the "games" page means how much people submitted a full run in the last 50 days



so thats why when cyclowns submitted his 11 IL it didnt increase the number that time

gur bingo is hard to make



cus the game is way more linear than something like celeste



celeset bingo is goood



Could do IL stuff



Don't have to do a run, but just hop around levels



Like L50 blockless



idk what else would go on there



really hard shit



49 slam dunk



22 skip no setup



could incorporate hardmode



"6 unique scoring screens"



or something



28 spinnerless



7 spinnerless



that ones pretty easy



27*



but it loses a lot



...no



It's not _that_ bad

And you can also skip it



It's bingo. You just have to get one line

Sorry



28 spinnerless is definitelya good one for bingo



u could have like



get a sub 5 time



maistlin counter



Do an HSG



do a wk



do 43 hsg 3 times in a row



Do h11 blockless



thats the one that no one goes for



Yeh



Have one column be crazy hard stuff



8 ihook



actually nah, that wouldnt work



yea 8 ihook



if 1 column is stupid hard, people have to do columns, not rows



since nobody can get those



so maybe have like 2 very hard ones



carefully place stupid hard stuff so that one shows up on every row column and diagonal



So the entire thing is impossible?



yea



🤦‍♀️



by "stupid hard" i dont mean 11 blockless

i can think of a few things that are about as hard as 11 blockless



- h11 blockless
- 35 underswing
- true 36 skip
- 44 no blocks activated
- 4 halted wallkick



just make it completely impossible



This would block everything

yea



45 skip



that could work



over true 36 skip



What is "halted wallkick"



when you wallkick while falling you dont go far



so on tas levels like 4 you have to grapple twice so that your veritcal momentum halts while youre doing the wallkick



What is "true 36 skip" also



36 in one grapple



ah



well its always one grapple



but its just



yea



full dicks out



1 grapple and 1 jump



grapple straight into the end

How much time does that save



a good amount



like .3 over an optimal normal 44 lol



The most useless wk ever. So useless you can barely even see it. https://youtu.be/6p6o7HG_V_o?t=191



I think I might stop at sub 5. Don't know if I really want to spend the time to get good enough for sub 4

the name towny slide makes me think of this



but remixed



with townys voice for the notes



yo, i liked the idea of a GURbingo



binGUR



:KEKW:



i cant believe im doing 32 wk every run now
oboy more resets



if we ever do GUR bingo we should do it with level select allowed



yea for sure



yo 29 wk is not that hard actually



might add into runs



yeah its one of the easier ones



yeah



im very happy with my wk consistency, its a lot easier than i thought



im hitting 23 and 32 1st try 70% of the time



you'll say that until you need seven wallkicks for 32 one time



and then it all starts crumbling



i mean, i reset for anything until 40



so it really doesnt affect me that much, if i fail like 5 times just reset



but i see how it may be annoying



damn not even rtd is that harsh on his runs lol



i think rtd resets for anything in 1-20



yea thats what i do



i reset for 1-20 and i only reset in 21-50 if i lose like 10 seconds



im not proud of hearing this ;-;



actually maybe more like 5 secs



id say these daus im trying to be less harsh



liike, 4 seconds behind good pace, i wont restart (i'd do it before)



and that's been helping me  ngl



youvce been getting like 1:37 for like 1-30 and 2:31ish for 1-40



which is more than enough to get a sub 4 with a good 41-50



I've gotten a PB on a +7.5 thru 30, so I reset +5 thru 20, +10 thru 40, and finish every run that makes it past that



hmmmmmmmm



ok! I'll try to reset less and make my own acceptable times



hope it'll help have a better end game



i think if you reset less you'll be more consistent iin general



I mostly do that to build up my endgame consistency



i reset for like low 28s in 1-10 and i had ass consistency for 1-10



like once i get a run past 20 or 30



i kinda break the mindblock for 1-10



and i can get it the next try



easily



so if i'm stuck in 1-10 or on 1 i'll just force myself to do a no reset run for a bit



accidentally just golded 1-10 right after i said that




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/779936945870471168/unknown.png



LOL



i start runs in that mindset sometimes and then i fail 1 and remember how humiliating it is



i think imma change my runs a lil bit



reset way less and go for as many tricks as possible



eventually i'll hit enough of them to pb



what wks can i do besides 5, 6, 22,  23, 32



5 wk is really not worth it, saves like 0.13 seconds



but 6 its very worth it



do 29 wk



what is considered a halted wallkick exactly?



and does it have any difference to performing it?



grapple right before you wk



to stop vertical momentum



29 wk doesnt save time unless you get it mega fast



29 only saves time if 1st try



but it aint that hard so its worth it



it only saves like .3 for me and thats if i get it really fast



can i hold up all time?



or only after releasing the first grapple?



it probably works either way



just need to be close enough to the wall



you can



technically hold up the whole way



but thats be ludicrously hard



you can also wallkick by pressing up the same frame you release grapple

{Reactions}
🤝 


which is far easier for halted wallkicks



woah, its way easier for hwk



thanks for the tip \:D

same but with 23 wallkick



i wouldve definitely gotten like



at least a sub 5 by now



if i didnt keep going for 50 skip



Yo pansear, I only started doing 50fast after I got a sub 4:30, so I'd recommend you doing the same, but if you get good in 50fast now, it will save a lot of good runs on the future



And 50 fast only saves time if you don't take an age to pass the last pillars (like I take, cuz I learned it too late) so I'd recommend you continue doing it



Do the HSG, saves a fuck ton of time and it's not so hard to learn :D



ive been thinking about learning it yeah



is there an easy way to practice ?



I mean, there's a level towny made on the level creator, but for you it would be better to practice the level as whole



Cuz if your last pillars be slow it won't save much time



i was looking at that file in #custom-levels but i had no idea how to play it



Me too lol



Im waiting for the full version of 4.0 to release



Cuz the only trainer that runs custom levels is the 4.0 but it's on beta yet



oo



So I didn't bother to mess with yet



i think my best run today entered level 50 at exactly 4 minutes



:pogu:



i dont know what time that wouldve been if i actually beat level 50



Probably 4:17



thats  good



Or more, if you don't do the HSG



If you dont do the HSG it would be like 4:24



arcanod bop incoming?



maybe 2 if lycro submarine 4s



also you can play the custom levels on gurtrainer 4 beta



or me/sensual can just hack it into an swf



cyclowns on his way to make haunted swf 3



i wanna try and make a legit haunted swf



corrupted shit



cuz it sounds fun



actually personalize 47



pull windows account name -> convert it into noise -> ??? -> randomly generated level



wtf does submarine 4s means in this context



submarine is shortened to sub

(i know it's joke)



The music combined with GUR music, sounds just amazing



tragic towny slide attempt



i watched it back and  my failed 50 skip was Really slow anyway



yooooo



is it possible to hsg off the leftmost block in 46 and finish the level



trying to reroute minimum grapples



my old sheet has 37 as one grapple which im pretty sure is bullshit



oh nvm just got it



its hard as fuck though



YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



congrats on the sub pansear



thats just the start



bruh hardmode sucks



every run i get past 3 just dies to 4



@MaistlinRajere are you *sure* 39 is possible in one grapple



it was on that challenge spreadsheet



oh wait i see the mistake that im making



ok got it



that is asinine



ok im getting it fairly?? consistently actually

still annoying



i cant replicate 37 though



that looks  not fun



i am partly inclined to try to do a true minimum grapple run



as in  if i grapple and then die i have to reset



so that the whole run is minimum total grapples



but 24 is fucking horrible



how many is 24 ?



2



thaats the  vertical hgs right ?



yes but you have to do it high enough so that you dont grapple the wall at the end



ive done that  a few times in runs i think

main roadblocks would be 24, 29, 37, 39, 41, 46 if its 2



inb4 you can make the first block fall then jump off of it to the top



to make it 1



how would you do 34 in 0?



jump

so the less grapples% has been improved?



34 is a small jump



full jump hits the ceiling which  lowers your momentum (?)



1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+1+2+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+2+1+3+3+1+3+1+4

hold on i mightve miscounted



oops



no i think thats right



god 37 is hard



34 was already 0 when we first thought about lg%, right?



no it was 1



evolution noice



adobe crash player just froze in the middle of a 2:29 40pace



letsgo



Yeah. Didn't cyclowns do it yesterday?



without any more grapples*



Minimum grapple run sounds fun



yeah, we thought about that some months ago



Uhhhh can't you land on the last block and jump to the exit?



i suggested it and doggo routed it



i also suggested the less jumps category



@Doggo Are you working on minimal jumps rn?



that was routed a while ago with very minimal room for improvement



also yes you can do that in 24



that makes it far easier



TAS wasnt even existent when "we" made minimum grapples and jumps (we in " cuz i didnt help in anything lol)



I wonder if anyone will ever discover new tech



probably



I mean like HSG/WK



Not strats



oh



i still think something will be found



if we just discovered wallclimb some days ago



we didnt



I didscovered wallclimb ages ago



it was just a meme strat bc of how slow it was



oh



lol did not know that



I wallclimbed H10 like 8 years ago



That was the ultimate meme

alternatively



What's the record on 1?



Errr



3.7 something



How the fuck did I type 1 when I meant 42



...



9.70



LOL I almost said htf do you do 20 in 1 grapple



Cause nobody uses the block



I think, but I'm not sure, that 24 might be doable in 1 grapple



If you grab the top of the first block, wait til it get to the apex, then swing right you _miiiight_ be able to HSG off the right block



I think you'd have to manage to grapple the top of the block, as close to the top right corner as possible



yea idk about that one



Same for 25 if you can manage to get the ultra boost when you release

oh right yeah



thats done in minimum jumps too



slightly differently



No that can be done in 1 jump



Just jump onto the first block



min jumps does it in 0



wat\



Oh you can grab the top block without jumping



yep



What if I told you I did 29 in 1 grapple too



i would tell you that youre baiting



I didn't, but what if.... 🙂



theres actually two ways of doing 29 in two and they both suck



Is one of them grab the block, then wk the middle?



ye



the other is a flawless cyclowns/merpell setup



htf do you do 37 in 1

since were doing minimum input runs im trying to beat the game in minimum left presses now



My 4.5s recording is too large?

LOL nice



That's epic



that is the second time i have  ever done a wallkick



Could also be done by grappling up top and swinging left without pressing left?



i think 24 requires 1 left press



i dont



grapple to the second block, grapple the right wall as high as possible, halted wallkick onto the third block, go to fourth, win



for a wallkick, do you have to do any horizontal inputs ?



no



cool



im   starting to learn wallkicks now i think



you will get the word record



i dont think 29 is possible



25 technically wouldnt need a left press but



mmmmmmyeah



25 doesnt



29 is possible



with an upward wallkick

jesus



ok im   pretty sure 39 cant be saved



wallkick op



wait  maybe ?



i think 39 can be saved actually



i think you could do 39 in tas



when you swing and your grapple is wide



and you let go of the direction youre holding



you fluctuate in both directions



so you could very slowly go left that way



39 is possible



cant you do this and wallkick

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/780182100439334933/unknown.png



no



wallkicks cap your downward speed



so youd just go into the lava and die



42 ,



42 definitely possible with wallkicks



but



not rta



I just did 39 with no left inputs



ho w



Mad skillz

I can't upload vid, so hop in voice general



i think  45 should be possible ?

how are the alternate categories going?



you can beat the game without pressing left



theoretically



TAS-only?



24 and 42 would be very very hard but probably possible rta



the rest isnt even debatably tas only

KEKW 


some runners make music kek



look at simply for example



u gotta plug



does anyone know if other flash games have autosplitters developed



im working on one for GUR



YOOOOOOOOOOOO



and its a little complicated because the process i'm pulling from is the adobe flash content debugger thing



and not an actual game executable



ive looked on the livesplit autosplitter list and i cant find any flash games that have autosplitters for their swf versions



so idk maybe im breaking new ground



maybe cyclowns is just THAT poggers



MAXPOGGERS



that or this just doesnt work and thats why theres none



^ that too



most of autosplitters see the completion inside the game data



some caveats is that it requires you to use the SWF that's listed on src



giveuprobotnoadultswim



and also the adobe flash player content debugger and not any other program that runs flash games or w/e



but if i do this right it'll also allow you to split by IL



so you can see IL times in your actual pb runs

{Reactions}
POGGERS (2) pogu 


which should be cool



YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



no promises that i can make this work with flash



no expectations



if you do you'll be making history, but no pressure



i think ppl just dont do it because flash games are mostly played on the web version



but all the web versions of GUR suck ass except blipz



so ppl just use the swf



will there be any way to grow the community if the flash site doesnt exist anymore



well the src page still exists



it'll be harder for sure



yeah



but yea we can grow the community solely through just idk



promoting it as a good speedgame



maybe towny can make some random vid that goes viral 👀



i mean, if people download emulators to run old games, its not like 100% of the people wont download a flash player



alternatively, a solution to run flash games on web again



theres someone working on something like that



i dont remember what its called though



i think that only chrome wont support flash



firefox still does



so like, its not like the ultimate end of them or something like that



nah i think flash is getting discontinued by adobe itself

but idk im no expert



ouch



thats sad so



yea



flash is getting merked in about a month



dec 31 2020



:YEPsad:



thats a fitting 2020 end ngl



definitively



flash games made the childhood of so many people (including me), its so strange seeing it go away



i remember spending the whole day on my dad's old computer playing 1000 different games per day



i dont want it to go away :YEPsad:



wtf happens to kongregate/armorgames when flash dies?



definitively a not-poggers moment :YEPsad:



i guess they're going to work like gamejolt or something like that



or use another look-a-like to flash (if that's possible im no expert)



html5 games with unity/etc are the replacement



theres a lot of those on kongregate as well



just usually not as good



there are other frameworks for making games with webgl



phaser or whatever



thats good to hear



im gonna do like a flash game marathon in december



play through red remover again and shit



dont speak the legendary names again, i dont want to cry :YEPsad:



i will play final ninja zero again too



the whole sift heads series



playing happy wheels and getting roasted by the teacher cuz it was "too violent" :YEPsad:



good news flash autosplitters arent new ground i just couldnt find any initially



they arent terribly different either so this should be possible

i guess



Good luck dude
Would be amazing with a real splitter

{Reactions}
widebot 


massive gl cyc



I find it very fascinating how much and how far this community goes with it being relatively small



yeah, that always amaze me



Tournaments that's small, Guides that Prolly won't help many, hundreds of hours of TASing things I never thought were possible. Maybe even autosplitter that definitely takes longer to create then the time it'll save. I mean, I've put at minimum 1500+ hours to learn programming from scratch on a dead language just because why not.

Small community but always great to see how it evolves and that we at least tries to get to the big leagues
Now ill shut up before I get lame



Oh BTW, there's this dude on yt
EasySpeezy
He kinda blew up with the whole cooking momma ordeal

So he gets 150-600 or even 2 mil views on random Speedrunning games

He has a discord where he takes challenges so I think it would be an amazing opportunity to jump in and challenge him. I mean it's hard for him to pick when you're one.

But, if we said like the entire GUR community challenges him to get a sub 5:30 time and be a bit sassy with it its a higher chance. Its not that many submissions, I mean it's many but not thousands

I think at least we should try, it doesn't hurt and would be amazing if it worked



maybe?



it would be sick to have some more exposure



Exactly



i commented on one of his vids challenging him to get a sub 4



YOOOOOOOO THATS A GOOD IDEA



give up robot i think is like



1500 hours. wow thats dedication



one of those games that a lot of people played cuz it was a popular flash game



but ppl just forget about over time



yep



we should go on his discord and challenge him



he speedruns virtually anything so



maybe?



Think we should send at the same time so he knlws



thats a good idea



lemme enter the server kekekeke



And it's always good to use some clickbaity words so he can use it better

So challange and like don't think you can and entire community and over the top



I'm already there, just waiting for you guys



I'm there too



Is it better to request challange, like 6 disco balls/sub5:30
Or to request a speedrun



i requested a sub5 lol



LETS TALK IN HIS CHAT FASTBOEYS



should i @ everyone?



fuck it I'm doing it

i hope he plays give up robot



we gotta



grow that community



give me

we're going on his server and "asking" him to speedrun the game



i will let lycro lead the charge

do the captcha



you have to read the rules

I vote @rtdrtd67 for the run, but it''d be fun to commentate



i'm 17 :KEKW:



Well you don't have to tell them that



true



So, who here is older than 18?



me maistlin and klice lol



maybe cyclowns idk him that well



also rtd



wink



tbf i don't think gur qualifies because it has been on both agdq and sgdq



in bonus streams but still



gur2 gdq run? :KEKW: :KEKW:



Well you don't have to tell them that



god damn you guys are bad at lying lol



Also, there's a link to a list of all games that don't qualify, and Give Up Robot was not on there



Seems like a great opportunity then. Should qualify as well because it's like only small games



@rtdrtd67 @MaistlinRajere we already have that GSA video we can use, so filling out that form would be easy. Lets check it out tonight



cyclowns is 16 iirc



im 18   im goign to run give up robot at gdq

Hey guys I have a question about recording if was recording my gameplay and my gameplay stop were it’s showing the disco ball is it alright or not ?



i would prefer if you have the time shown at the end



but if you have ingame timer on then i can see that time at the end



unfortunately no we did not think about it.  The recording just stopped near the end.



did you have the game timer on?



If your time was above 5 minutes, you can submit a screenshot

Wow you put your beer down only once every few days?



4:15 gang



@Towny send me this fuckin vid or imma go berserk on ur ass



it just finished rendering, gimme a sec



oh wait you're making it



i understand now



im sorry for my hateful comments



toxic af but its okay cause you're a god damn legend



you can step on me



you cant make me



just sent u the vid



it may be a second of two out of sync, cause the chat starts when you hit start stream, but you're probably gonna use a local recording



wow merpell turning up the heat on Towny much?



In the spirit of Thanksgiving, since he sent that video to you, you should invade his homeland and murder his family, friends, and community, and then have a feast to celebrate it.



#JustPilgrimThings



its not thanksgiving here get fucked



Thank you for those kind words.

Wait I might stream some osrs instead



What should I do



:omegalul:SRS



It'd be a brand new account



Do you use your same login for rs3 and osrs?



you can yeah



and your membership carries over



Cause I'll be fucked if I put my login info in Runelite



My account is 16 years old and worth >2B I ain't risking that



kek



How much of a difference does Runelite make?



I only use it to increase the resolution of the game



4K RUNESCAPE POGGERS



fuck I have to log in to rs3 to buy a bond



Oh my god the fucking login music



Nostalgia much



FeelsStrongMan



woo bought 500k more earth runes while I was gone



Should I create an ironman?



do it :pogu:



Its actually pretty fun



cause I think the GE ruined a lot of the magic of the game



LOL bonds are 28m



so having to do everything yourself brought an interesting challenge



just spent 28.6m for a bond kek



is that in rs3 bucks?



yup



ah okay



wtf is premiere club



rs3 currency is pretty inflated



and i have no idea what premiere club is



fuck idr my password



did you know that rs password are case insensitive

@Towny hired at $0/hour



I have a program called twitch downloader, but i don't remember where i got it from



if you ever want me to download chat for you, just send me a vod link I don't mind



how would i have chat on stream though



edit it in

41 secret hardest level i knew it all along



:KEKW:



I just crushed 29



sub 5



what theme should i use



o shit nice maistlin



By the skin of my teeth



dark theme might fit best against your black background



but its easy to change



ya



i wonder if i could just capture chrome tho



probably



nightdev is a lot easier though



Honestly sub 4.5 is probably doable TAS



imo



Wait it already is



🤦



sub 4 is doable tas



its sub 4 lmao



The 1 swing def helps



Can def optimize where you grapple the undeswing tho



inb4 improve 30



yeah no



I just ihooked straight into the lava...



Can 30 be faster by grappling the last spinner for like 3 frames



Just enough to not ihook it



@rtdrtd67 your 34 can be improved by doing hole in 1 with a limpkick on the wall



I think sub 2 might be possible but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯



can't seem to get the right angle for a hole in 1 on 34



You have to slow down the tiiiiniest bit



u mean in mid-airr?



eah



eah



Yeah



yea but i get 2.3x then



Do a wk at the end?



o yea i just got 2.23



lemme see

btw I have an idea for 36



limpkick on the ceiling at the start to get max vertical speed



Probably only TAS viable tho



We do a downwards HSG in the TAS, does the same thing but it looks better



???



How



Oh nvm got it



Does anyone else find that 1.0 lags more?



yup



I think it's a difference of file type



cause 1.0 is an swf



the later versions are exe



I finally bopped merpell



I got a 3:43.37



\o/



Put him in his place



...first place 😭



soon you get yourself a ball, congrats on bopping a past wr holder



@Towny Is sub 4.73 possible on 40? Even with TAS?



Am I seriously going to race this guy :YEPsad: holy shit I'm fucked



But CONGRATS AGAIN CSER!!!!! you're bopping everyone in this shit



Hey I'm gotten a 3:59 if you race me you'd whup me



Do not stop the grind!



But that's cuz you're rusty rn, cser is on fire :YEPsad:



Holy shit I had an idea for 40



If it works I will be so hype



maistlin slide?



Yeah



Thanks people



The level is cycled, so the only two parts of the level that can be optimized are the first frame grapple, and the HSG itself. Both of which are optimized. I don't think it can be improved with current strats



do you know what I mean?



Yes



I think I just had an idea for new strats tho



uh oh



I'm prepared for this to make no sense




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/781631686017810472/Cjheese.jpg



you're a mad man



Arrows are movement, lines are grapples



:POGGERS:



like hsg up? Might be hard since the block is moving up



No, HSG rightwards



Then JUMP



ohhhh



hmmm



You won't have to wait for the block to get all the way up



might save some frames



Quite a few



I'll look into it today or tomorrow, might be able to make it happen



The only thing I'm not sure about is if you can actually do the HSG



Since you might not be able to go up anymore



the fact that towny slide is tighter than normal hsg makes me think the platform probably moves up faster than you can



OH IT IS POSSIBLE



:pogu:



RTA-viable? :KEKW:



jk, how much timesave?



That's a good question



I didn't save time cause I clipped the platform



waitwut



Proof of concept:




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/781634182781992960/Cheese.mp4



is it even possible to jump lmao



Yeah I did



yeah, I've jumped rta after a standard towny slide



You can combine a jump and an HSG



no i mean like jump and clear the plat



yooooooooooooo



timesave incoming



I mean if you do the HSG later maybe



And TAS could def input left for a few frames to slow down



well if you press left, you reduce the momentum. Ideally you don't wanna do that



I'm not 100% convinced this will work but it's worth a shot



send the TAS file



Yeah. It might still save time



That was in 1.0 LOL



i mean, why not?



wat



lol



good job



Yeah but it might still save time since you don't wait for the platform as much? idk



Oh fuck you can save time on 41



yo, if in rtd new wr description he says he lost about 11.5 seconds, is 3:1x real? :monkaS:



his sum of best is 3:21 I believe



you'd need to play flawlessly



and if that analysis includes missing 34 and 36 wks



yeah, but he says he lost about 5s on 34



then



ye



idk cuz i did not see the video yet



in SRC, in his description of the submission he describes his timelosses



😱



So you can save at least 0.04 on 41 by jump to grab the spinner then moving away from it



yeah cuz you gain more speed if realeasing while extending your grapple



I still  call it ERS cuz no one gave it a corfimed name



Fucking Maist special got a 1.43

Motherfucker I did it again



Nice! @Daveed



@csercser3 my cheeks were clenched for you on 49 lmao



cheer to you man !



@merpell Did you get it/



no fuck that shit



lol



Gah, @SensualPudding's 7.77 50 is nuts. I tried for over an hour yesterday and only came close once.



its amazing how close it is to tas



well actually, the TAS was built off of it, so it makes sense



but it's still amazingly tight



you came to sensual's lvl 50? 😳 😳 😳 😳  username checks out

{Reactions}
🙄 


8=====D~~~



I came close once then failed the HSG 😦



Then I decided I was finished



🥎



It's mostly that last swing that saves a huge amount of time
Good luck in beating it tho, I'm pretty proud of it myself

TAS is Prolly possible sub 7 though so



itll get to sub 7 as soon as we add the limpkick on the falling platforms



and the first platform



there is a lot of room for tas improvement on 50



I've thought about improving it a few times but then I remember the last wk an nah, it's so tedious



reasonable



And ye Maistlin got a better 41 and 50 could be better
Isn't that all 41-50 gold?



idr, did you use the blocks or hsg?



HSG



if he used the blocks and got a 7.77 THAT would be fascinating



ngl



Well the blocks are doable in like 1 swing



but they take a lot of time



holy shit my 43 HSG consistency is so trash rn



idk why,  iwas fine last week



dammit



try to get your grapple on the top left corner of the block. I find the trick is easier to pull off that way



I'm doing it this way, as I always did, but for some reason it aint working 99% of the time



wall kicks are stupid



nvm did 3 in a row



whenever I find a strat difficult I'm just going to complain about it here



because whenever I do it becomes easy



getting a sub 3:30 is so stupid



yes



PB :pogu:

im pretty sure my 3:47 is like



2:33 or something



bc no 22, 29 skips etc



I want to thank you guys so much for telling me to reset less, its sure making my 41-50 better



where did lvl 1 reset meta go Pepehands

1 death on 29 away from 3:2x feelsbadman



didnt have a good 1-20 either



idk if i wanna bother submitting because i'm stupid close to a 3:2x



noiceee



better start doing some runs :monkaS:



how much time does 45 hsg save



close to one second



not worth



at all



i think at this point i gotta do 22wk if i wanna wr



saves so much time



not so necessary



without it i'd have to do the rest of the run basically perfectly



if u can get consistent 1:30.xx or 1:31.xx it's good enough with about 2-3s of lenience



YO WTF CYC 3:32



I thought you were drunk just like maistlin when you said you were going to pb lol



Congrats!!



Sensual bop incoming

Congrats



Biggest threats right now is cyc and cser
Should really start doing runs again to try and keep my position

wtf is this



Prolly worth a shot



I found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOeAK-C9-yg



NANI???



tf



I think for the TAS you'd want to wk off the left block and not do the ceiling wk that I did



that video actually gave me appendicitis



If I had an appendix I would have too



@merpell I just submitted a bunch of ILs to SRC



I apologize, I think a few of them are invalid. I forgot to add a trailing 0 to the ms for a few of them, so I resubmitted them



And I think I put the wrong video in one of them



i thought you were still drunk?



Nah that was when I woke up



Like 3 hours ago



OK fixed them

26 41 and 47 is improved over TAS



41 and 47 are not very intuitive. You move away from the spinner to have a longer spinner while spinning so you go a weeeeee bit faster



Aaa, well those levels are so boring to TAS so they're almost RTA anyways



I'm still amazed we have so many people running GUR



Almost at 100 normal submissions

@Towny Did I tell you that I tried to make a HCIM in osrs and died in ~5 minutes



yeah to a cow



nice going kek



I DID IT



I DID 48 ONLY Z



its actually pretty easy now that i got it down



Ahhhhghhh I almost got sub 3 H2



3:03



Grabbing the first spinner after a wk is a pain in the ass



H2 is so janky. There's so much changing directions



Where is the TAS for hard mode? I'm curious to see the H2



I'll send what i have



Vid or the file?



Cause I see that the TAS is 2.95 and that's probably beatable rta

want the rest?



Nah that's good



ty



Wow that's pretty cool



I do it skipping the second spinner



@Towny How do you do the wk at the end of h3 consistently? I can never get the standing wks. I have to hold up



I dont do those anymore lol



Still, how do you do them



I haven't managed once



idk what to tell ya, you just gotta press grapple for two frames



while holding up of course



Doesnt up make you bounce



yeah unless you press it before you hit the ground



But you did it while standing on the ground

The wk at the end



yes



what about it



I was asking how you were wking without pressing up because you didnt jump



I AM HOLDING UP



you don't need to press up, you just need to have it held while hitting Z for two frames



So you landing while still holding up?



ya i press up before hitting the ground and hold it til the trick is done



my input display is in the bottom right



I didn't even notice that LOL

its official now



everyone hates h3



I still love it though



It's just terrible



no one thinks h3 is well designed*



👍



Now that I know you have to already be holding up, the wk is  much easier lol



@Towny What do you use to show your inputs?



nohboard



Easy to set up?



yeah, easy to download. Making a custom file to display inputs is fucking awful though



but I can send you mine



Sure

custom file to display inputs?



put that in the nohboard folder



then you can select it in the program



you could also just do window capture and game capture on OBS



and crop them



or you could make life easy for yourself and use that file lol



Making like 3 seperate captures on OBS would work, but it's more of a pain to do IMO



well just two



or i guess it would only be two

Rip



That would be funny if I just lowered my PB by 30 seconds



lowered the world record by almost 10 seconds



whats the biggest WR leap



actually i think its my 3:47



that was like 8 seconds below wr



weird flex but ok

{Reactions}
KEKW 


i did not realize it would be a flex



what was the wr after that



technically the biggest is from btspider to arcanod



supposedly on SRC



yea



since that one is like 25s



i was gonna sya



but its not very well documented back then so there was probably other times

i was not wrong



was



the only other active runner at that time was merpell



i think



when did rtd start



or at least active runner in like the top 20



me and rtd started around the same time i think but i think i submitted a run first



this run is painful to watch



i didnt even do 20 skip



first run i submitted was sep 30 2018



my first was like feb



mad lad got his first wr one week after he started lmao



nahh i was playin for awhile bfore



just no submission



ok



even still



i remember seeing cyclowns' 4min time and panicking cause i wanted to be the first to sub 4

seconded



how much time does this save???



:POGGERS:



on the one level you lose 2 seconds



but on the whole run you save 15



yeah gives you more momentum going into 33



timeloss :weirdchamp:



nah



i wanna make a SWF where momentum gets carried into levels



or where all of the levels are just stitched together



would be funny



just make one long custom level



yea that would be possible



All levels stitched together would be interesting



dont think your 40 strat works maist



?



Who are you

{Reactions}
LELW 


the hsg off the left



doggo



lol



do you know what 40 looks like



oh wait you said hsg



What's with the name change



i thought you said wallkick



its



a nickname



my discord name is still doggo



That's sad about 40



theres uhh



one way i see it working



but itd be annoying



oooooo



Do share



and probably not faster



so the hsg makes you move like



way too fast to jump



unless the block is super high



but if the block is super high then you cant scale up it by holding up with the grapple



What about a reverse hyperdash



bc it becomes level with your grapple



so you could maybe like



land on the block asap, jump up and grapple the floor of the top



and use that to hsg



but still youd have to be extremely high to not bonk



Yeah



Didn't I grab the floor of the top?



Or did I grab the wall?



no you grabbed the corner



anyway the 41/47 strat also works in 17 and 27



it actually saves a lot in 27



because you do it grounded



so you can also jump to the left



what 41/47 strat



turning left after pressing z



to make the spinner path shorter



that works?



yeah your grapple path doesnt change with your movement



so you can do whatever you want after you press z and itll still land in the same place



if youre further left to the spinner then youre more horizontal so the spin doesnt take as long



Fuck, I don't remember if I managed to do 11 jumpless



you did



i remember seeing it



you did



i just figured out how to make 48 consistent using that grapple trick



if you do the same thing while grappling off of the pillar after the 1st spinner its way easier



since ur grapple is a little longer



its also usually faster



which grapple trick




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/783424149834039346/unknown.png



oh



guess who just made hail mary 35 semi-viable



me



I've had it as a backup



Yep



I can get it about half the time



probably wanted to save time on 35 but was still too adamant about the cyclowns strat not being worth



yea the hail mary 35 is actually not that bad



you can hit the wall and st ill have enough vertical momentum to make it up



and it saves like .5-.7



even if it hits teh wall



what strategy is that?



well i tried to make a brain strategy involving the grapple trick thing and it does work



but its easier to just do the setup how its done in the IL



going under the block using just the momentum of the spinner



1 grapple



oooooh



like the IL



yeah, now I remembered



isnt the il going over with the second spinner



no lol



that was a joke IL I did one time



but its not faster



it got il tho



maybe at the time



id guess the jump strat made underswing faster



please forgive my ability to speak coherently



You're forgiven, my son



actually



still dont think im gonna use this strat unless im desperate



the top spinner goes in the same direction as the ones in 17/26/27/41/47



same. Its a last ditch effort for me



so it miiight be faster if you do the strat



doubtful



but



possibly



you know, you could have just said clockwise



you just bonk on the ceiling



too long



^



oh do you



sucks



even if you retract the whole way



i mean, doggos been getting optimizations like crazy lately, I'm guessing anythings possible at this point



but I doubt it



on 35



Don't say you guys wikl optimize 35 with another strat

Can maybe be one or 2 frames faster with the same but with the new, hmmm



sorry was testing my keyboard



++++++++++++++++++++



yup



the plus key works



-------------------------



lmao



> doggo's been getting optimizations like crazy
mostly maistlin

I'm flexible, just come to me when you have a time



How flexible?



2 am flexible?



What’s your lunch time? @MaistlinRajere



Whenever I feel like it 🤣

But seriously, ~12:30



Because tomorrow at 6 pm my time i have driving lessons, and be the time I have home it’s basically too late for me



The perfect time for a race!



Turn the steering wheel left for <-



Turn right for ->



Gas for extend grapple



Brakes for retract



playing gur on those tesla  dashboards



Honk for Z



i wonder if i can try something really dumb



mouse-only GUR



Click for Z?



move mouse right -> go right
mouse left -> left
left click -> grapple
right click -> jump



scroll up and down for grapple length LMAO



That would be horrible



yeah



You have to keep holding right



So you'd have to keep moving the mouse right



exactly



Could do it with a trackball



between every level you have to reset its position



just unbind left stonks



or pick your mouse up every once in a while



How about a touchscreen



robot moves to where you press



Or TPGUR



Twitch Plays GUR



Or those scrollbuttons that have 0 friction



Wheels i should say



twitch plays GUR seems very doable honestly



@hetheis How late are you usally available for a race?



WHO WAS THE MF THAT SAID JUMP IN 42?



21:30



9:30 pm for the uneducated



So like 1:30 pm



ok so what about that time on Thursday?



For you



Shouldnt be a problem



Err, 20:30

My mate just mixes something in FL studio and tells us to write some lyrics



It’s nothing compared to the Way you work



I use FL studio for drums, but I use Audacity for everything else



only instrument i play is bass guitar



i want a synthesizer eventually



Synthesizers are pog



expensive though, for a good one



I have a dusted Electric piano under my bed



I have never really had the interest to learn playing it



I have a hacksaw under my bed



It's actually a pretty cool instrument



you should learn piano, it's fun



i dont wanna 'learn keyboard/piano' so much as i just want a way to input midi notes that isnt by hand



cuz that shit sucks



i should probably learn it still though



That's called learning piano lol



if thats learning piano then i am a piano master



FL studio lets you turn your keyboard into a.. well keyboard



cuz i know what all the notes are



i could probably do that



doesnt translate well to my brain though



gur band when?



I'm in. I play guitar and sing poorly



I don't play the drums, but that won't stop me from pretending.



you ever just choke a 3:27 to 50 hhsg on gurtrainer 3 while not recording



Why the fuck are you doing runs on gurtrainer 3 and not recording



this is like the second time this week lmao



its less laggy

so i just have fun doing no reset runs

its a lot less laggy



at least as far aas i can tell with gurtrainer



It would also be nice to have an EXE version for download since flash dies at the end of the month



I support the idea



@merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell



if no one else has a problem with it then i dont see why not



if @SensualPudding can package it into an exe that would be cool



i can probably figure it out but he did it for gurtrianer so



im assuming with adobe air



if we do get a give up robot EXE, can we add the ESC key as a game reset? Or would that be just going way too far

{Reactions}
KEKW 


Cause if not we would have to close the program and reopen it to restart



-Not good!



yeah that would be good



separate key to immediately take you to the intro without resetting your settings to default



as long as it's before the Enter press, I'd be okay with that



yea thats why i specified intro



imagine being this bitter towards like ten seconds of reset time actually



gotta feel bad for sunshine runners



Lol doesn't sunshine allow for hacked files now?



i think so



not for the peons of course



only those with homebrew knowledge



I can't make a exe version of it yea

If you guys wanna add functions like that which ones?
I mean i could release like 4 betas in improved GurTrainer 4 till its bug less and could make that viable

When adding functions it gets hard to know what's acceptable



should let merpell guide what functions prolly



having a reset button would help a lot wth my autosplitter



Okay hell decide
Because technically I can make all functions "safe" or whatever with some time if functions are allowed



Yeah I think just the reset button. And maybe have the game retain settings like it does in the trainer, so you dont have to turn particles off every time



Thanks sensual



^ both very reasonable imo



Okay so both of them
Just tell me if anyone else want more

When does it have to be done?



Whenever you want, really



preferably before flash shuts down on dec 20



but doesnt really matter

Rip, I just got a PB for hard mode on GUR trainer



v sad



but if you can do it once you can do it again



fair



Sup @Petrik



Yo, an .exe would be cool af, its blatant obvious how cleaner the trainer is compared to the swf



it just needs to have a reset button, have particles off, game sound off and game timer on as default



do you guys think something more is necessary?



Nah, just have it retain setting like the trainer does



at least i think the trainer does that



ya it does



just checked



yeah, that's better cuz some ~creeps~ like to leave sound turned on



noice



I might leave sounds on but turn music off

that fixed it



epic



why tf is my liveplit not opening



well there goes a fun project i was enjoying working on

which flashplayer do i need to download?

not debug



which one

download the src one



that one 's debug



ye



does that work w the autosplitter?



idk



@Towny i need an adult



yooo ok it's the projector



this is kinda sick ngl



autosplitter doesnt want to work for me



debug doesn't work



which one works AAAAAAAAAAAA



debug doesn't quell



work



which one works?



ok i got it to work



so



debug doesnt work



you have to use the normal one



flash player projector



can some1 send the link pls



so we can fixate it



its also not working too well for me



maybe i messed it up or something



it thinks i got a 31 first 10 when i got a 29



What settings do you need on livesplit



ill make it work for debug too



actually the timer is working just fine i think im just splitting in rta



so thats on my end



yes compare to game time



ok



hm but the timer doesn't pause for deaths or lvl loads



it does



?



aight yeah its good now



i'm doing sth wrong then



compare to game time



right click



compare against



game time



and be using the regular flash player




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/784898634973839399/unknown.png



make sure the .exe file name is `flashplayer_32_sa`



another thing ive found is that you have to have the flash player open before you open livesplit or it wont work



that shouldn't matter



huh



well it is mattering



so thats weird



i'm pretty sure it doesn't



works the other way around too for me



strange



when i deactivate and reactivate the autosplitter in the splits menu it works just fine after that



ya thanks sm ero this is quite epic



|'m kind of a noob with livesplit , how do I open the autosplitter



yeah fr this is sick



are u in edit splits



wait



i did



i got it



haven't written the dumb readme yet so i can't link it loool



I need to write the levels splits myself right?



yeah



okok



there's a way to automate split creation, but it's unsafe in asl



also you can use excel or google sheets to make a list from 1-50



then select all of them and past them into the first field of the splits



but you do have to have 50 fields in livesplit first



wait



so i have to do a list from 1 to 50



in google sheets



and export it to livesplit?



nah like



you make 2 fields 1 and 2



hm




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/784901507085762570/unknown.png



like this right

then you select them both



and pull down on the square



right



until you have 50



this is the correct flash player you need to use btw

like this?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/784902445788037180/unknown.png



yeah so then you select all of those, press Ctrl+C, go into your Edit Splits window, click the first split name field and press Ctrl+V



kk



you just have to have 50 empty fields already



i'm sure someone else could also just send you their splits



thanks man!

I made my friend play GUR and he is thinking that 48 blockless is easier than with the block lol



25 minutes 1-40 not bad ngl



i think that's a fine time for a first playthrough



yeah it totally is



mine was like 19 minutes



i thinking the way i spoke sounded harsh



lemme change it



yep thats TOTALLY a great time LOL



i mean, for a first time



ugh i hate when people make fun of how well people play games for their first time



in my first playthrough i beat the game in 37 minutes lmao



i remember being pissed at lvl 42



the only one i hated was 50



game is complete baby mode until then



than i saw a guy doing it



just jumping



then i felt like a dumbass



me too



10 minutes of the playthrough went there



i just hated lvl 42,48 and 50



but thats probably cuz i was like 7 years at the time



i remember not knowing what to do in 43



should i add a popup for when someone opens livesplit with the autosplitter activated telling them to switch to game time



it would be good



there's a lot of people that dont know nothing about livesplit



i'm waiting for him to finish the game so I can show him what hard mode looks like



cool, that's in now too



what were your first playthrough times?



noice



i didn't really time mine



or even look at my time in the end



cause i was just playing through the game to check values for the autosplitter

I hate flash pointers forever now



this will be very helpful

Jesus



at least he finished it lol



yeah



gg



half of it was lvl 50



the game never imagined someone would take more than an hour to finish i guess lol



Hours just aren't coded in period



oooohhh



thats cuz they didn't think someone would take this long :LELW:



Feels like a big oversight



But maybe



i think thats cuz



most people



would give up



at hard levels



like



people as bad as him



but i obligated him to finish :KEKW:



I did hear there were plans for a standalone .exe for the whole game, so let me know when that's a thing

I'll implement that too then

I died to 47 and 41 actually 15 times and got 1 second slower then my pb

unless you finish a run then you have to manually reset it

even tho they're the same the one i downloaded directly from the adobe site did not work

here's a slightly better link



directly downloads blank splits



i was just wanting to link the webpage not the split download

yo how do i divide my splits?
like:
1-10
and theres the 10 levels
than 11-20
and just shows 1-10 as a segment



idk if im being clear



just like merpell one



in the layout setup



replace your splits component with subsplits



and put a - in front of every split you want to be a subsplit



eg: -level 1, -level 2



but if you want level 10 as a header like i have mine you just have level 10 without it



so i have to erase the splits on my layout and instead put only subsplits?



yes



gimme a sec



then I go to "edit splits"



?



ye



i can just send you mine if you want



and you can delete the times



please ;-;

to put my best segments i need to put them summed or alone? (like lvl 2 7.02 or lvl 2 2.02?) (counting lvl 1 as 5 seconds )



alone



yep alone



segment means the individual levels



split would be summed



OHHHH



kk i was kinda confused with splits and segments



so segments alone and split summed

you can if you want but it doesnt matter



i opted to fill it out by just doing runs



^



hmmmmm



i'll leave it this way



yo, how do i make it show me the decimals?



cuz mine just shows like 2:55



instead of 2:55.03



edit layout -> layout settings -> splits -> accuracy  hundredths

theres probably another place to do taht



theres a bunch of places you have to do it if you want it globally

is it showing as an image or as an archive for you guys?



yea idk why its embedding like that



me 2



wtf



im loving the autosplitter, its helping me see if some little changes are worthy or not very precisely



10/10



And I don't need to use my brain anymore to calculate if I'm behind



11/10



tbh i like being able to time the jump on 1 based on the autosplitter



thats a plus for me



i noticed that



i already had it down as muscle memory but its nice



me 2



this is so cool



its like the game received an update



lmao



idk why but there's times where the autosplitter does not reset



like 30% of the time



may be the macro resetting it too fast



?



nah that happens even if you reset by hand



yea



i dotn use macro and it happens



i found just closing livesplit and flash player and reopening them fixes that



when it happens



or merpell is just as fast as the macro



true

😳 


I just need to reset again and then it works



yeah i just reset agian



the only downside of the splitter is that it's making me look more at the splitter than the game :KEKW:

my sob is 3:18.99 now with level splits

i think i could probably get it lower with like 22 wk in my best segments



I'd like to see my sum of best but I didn't even finish a run yet :KEKW:



im stupidly close to a 3:2x



just need to get a little lucky

probably cuz half of time I was looking at the splitter kek



I really like the attempt counter tho



i try to finish a run every 5-10 attempts



otherwise my consistency goes in the trash



YOOO SO THATS WHY IM BAD :pogu:



i quite like how it actually count 1 failures as attempts



jk i was playing more for fun



as opposed to inputing segment times



i was going to say that



the word left looks really weird when you type it out a bunch of times

this has happened to me once before but i wasnt recording



has this happened to anyone



Weird



new grapple fuckery tech



That has happened to me on 44 I think



THIS IS HUGE



kinda cringe



i cant reproduce manually

{Reactions}
KEKW 


that sounds



wrong



It might have something to do with pressing up and down at the same time



if we can get the inputs for it it would be cool



cuz thats definitely potentially useful



in tas



wait nevermind you're not holding up and down



oh yeah my inputs are visible



Wow



maybe pressing down a frame before you release?



What the actual fuck



fuck this game so many stupid mechanics



glitchless when



run invalidated because you accidentally did a grapple glitch



exactly



stonks category no controversy whatsoever



if its pressing down a frame before you release i would have encountered that way more



i've only ever encountered it in that grapple on 1



so it might have to do with the angle



Yeah, it would be way more frequent



all runs to be done while recording for tas



There must be something about angle



And or hitting the wall with max grapple length



Like



I think it's the one frame down press before letting go of z



At the same frame your grapple gets max length it sticks on the wall



Or something like that



i think it has to do with the 1 frame down press + the fact that i had basically no vertical velocity when i did it



i think



that is the hypothesis



maybe



someone can try and tas it



FINALLY

obviously just grapple rng



clearly some shit happens when you release grapple that we do not fully understandf



im sure this would have an application somewhere in the tas but im not sure where



20 and 45 probably



maybe 24 if its extreme enough



theres an input display so i can try to recreate this

sheeeiiiit



i tried for 2 hours the other night to recreate it on gurtrainer



allegedly

{Reactions}
widebot (3) 


the down press appeared again



interesting...



Would be really nice to understand it for like TAS 45 or something



Wouldn't surprise me if cser does it on 3.0 after 10 min of attempts now



if we have the inputs that'llk make things a lot easier



to understand it



is there a plugin for nohboard or something to record inputs?



I'll try to get it in gurtrainer



i dont think it's 100% accurate anyways but im curious



I just pretended like it was a wk and it worked



i have a theory for why it happens



well



go on then



Enlighten us



i talked about it a bit in #tas



the cia probably killed him so we couldn't get any info



I record at 30 fps and the video never shows me holding z and down on the same frame



wks happen because when you press up the game forces you to a certain grapple length



So at most I held down for one frame



the same thing happens when you press down, just only if your grapple is longer than max length



so if your grapple is longer than max length, you press down for a frame, then release on the next



it should send you with momentum in the direction of grapple contraction



but since you're moving right the horiz momentum cancels out and you just go up



no idea if thats why it works



you'll notice that on the videos for both me and cser's swinghops



we never press down during the grapple until the very end



meaning that the game never corrects our length until the end



That's a good point!



Just like in wallkicks, you aren't corrected until you push up or down



that's a pretty good theory



The grapple does look like max length



makes sense



my only gripe with the theory is that the grapple in both of our videos doesnt look longer than max length



I think just be a 1 or 2 frame down press at max length



maybe it is longer than max length, but its jsut hard to tell



it is totally possible to get grapples longer than max length just by grappling normally



yeah



the grapple is set to retract when it hits max length



but the collision for the grapple bit is presumably larger than a point



so it cna get a little larger



why does the game have to be programmed like this



is my theory



GUR was made for a game jam



why does it have to have smb1 turn left to clip into the wall bullshit



and then refurbished into a decent game for adult s wim



yo happy birthday @Klice !



:POGGERS: ?

yeah



i think thats longer than max length



its hard to tell



oh yea it is



the blocks are the distance of max length



well just get into the situation and go up a bit then down again



thats an easy way to tell no?



or, press down in that scenario and notice that you clip back to max length



yeah



unless it's literally pixels beyond the max grapple



pixels beyond max grapple is hard to notice but definitely enough to get a boost out of similar to wks



Here is what happens when you press down (and how I set it up)

here's an mp4



this should be fairly easy to replicate on gurtrainer now



this also explains why some swinghops are smaller than others



So when you grapple something while falling i guess, the grapple probably puts you past max length, then when you press down, it corrects you to max length?



when you press down



up wont correct you to max length



right thats what i meant, lol



sorry



i say we call this the anti-wk :POGGERS:



just say fuck it and call it a vertical wallkick



but theres no wall



not that it has to have a name, seems somewhat useless to me



dont worry about it



swinghop is still a good name



the cyclowns launch



but i've never been much of an innovator so who knows



this HAS to have some application somewhere



especially depending on how big the boost can get



hmm then this isn't applicable for 20?



cuz i don't see how we would get past max length



it should be



maybe not



with the new 20 idk



if we can find a better way to consistently get past max length



but yea with new 20 it might not even save time



o yea right



tell me ya'll aren't gonna try to use this in runs



fuck no lol



maybe rtd will try



or cser



it has wk frame leniency and it requires a stupidly hard setup



so probably not



(also I allegedly got that swing hop first try)



heres an interesting thought



the boost should just send you in the direction of grapple contraction



so you can probably do a swinghop at any point in the grapple



meaning it can probably send you more horizontally



wait, so it depends on grapple rng?



no



this is separate from grapple rng



GUR RNG :omegalul:



well grapple rng is at least partially understood now



Doesn't exist



is anyone trying to tas swinghop



i'll try to



I'm gonna check it out in a minute



I'm trying rta on gurtrainer

Lemme pack this up and send it over

not in #tas banned



o shit its real



so its pressing down the frame you release Z?



woah, if you delete one of the swing frames before the release, he goes even higher!



makes sense



in my theory i guess that would be because the direction of contraction is more upward



and if you add two frames he also goes higher



this is definitely exploitable. I'm guess the hard part is getting the initial grapple



presumably it has something to do with the momentum you have as well



if you did a swinghop while completely still does it still give a boost



i doubt



I messed around trying that, it didn't seem to work, but I didn't spend too long on it



now the question is does it work for any grapple length



presumably not



Yeah I'd assume it would only work if you're past the max value



if i add even one down press during the grapple it doesnt work



so looks like my theory is maybe right



Yup I'd say it's pretty clear how it works now



this is great



and if i add too many up frames it also doesnt work



if i add 1 or 2 it still does



which makes sense



adding up frames also dampens the boost you get as well



which is in line with the theory



so the highest swinghop requires the angle most around 270* and also the highest momentum



so im willing to bet the best angle for a swinghop is probably like 280 degrees



either way you can just use trial and error



also should scale with how long your grapple is past the max length



i'm interested to see if theres any places where we can get a super long grapple



like abusing a fast moving platform



here's a swinghop on 36

Bravo!



DAMNBOE



GRATS



rtd be sweating after everyone getting their 26's



I got a 27.38 right after, but my level 1 was a 5.22



So if I got a 4.5 I would've gotten a 26.66



For the benefit of anyone who doesn't use the TAS but wants to stay updated on the development, we've discovered a new trick called swinghop. Here is it being used on 26. We can basically get a lot of vertical speed, all we need it enough space to max out the grapple https://streamable.com/qb8mpb

this is a swinhop + wallkick btw



Would a 26.66 have been a 1-10 wr?



i think so



what was mine yesterday



like 26.68?



yeah



I got a 27.38, but my level 1 was a 5.22. So, if I got a 4.5 for level 1, I would've gotten a 26.66



my 26.68 had a 4.2 level 1



wait what



your 2-10 must be very silly



5 and 6 wk first try



i had 6 wk, no 5 wk



you're crazy



i do 6 wk in runs now



saves like 0.5



yeah, even tho 5wk does not save much time



and its stupid easy



6wk is totally worth it



5wk saves like 0.18 so i dont botehr

is there a faster way to reload the game than to go into files and choose swf?



Sadly not
But a macro can make it really quickly



how do you guys wallkick??



grapple a wall while  right next to it
make your grapple shorter 
game doesnt like a grapple that short do it pushes you away slightly
at the same time as it does that   stop grappling



_ _
i think



so something like
grab
grab+up
horizontal direction away from the wall

didn't record it...



@pansear ❤ Thank you



non-technical explanation for wallkick is just



hold up against a wall and press grapple for exactly 2 frames



technical explanations  usually make hard tricks easier for me



Can't you do a wk with like 3 Z presses as well?
Just that 2 is minimum?



you cant do it in 3 if youre holding up



Aaa, okay



i have way too many ideas for a gur version of the 120 stars promo

congrats cser



Thanks



holy man .53 wtf



all you really need for a 25 is fast 1, 5/6wk, and a good 4/7/8/9



which is a lot



In case you were wondering, the run did to 2 deaths on level 12 and a death on 19



funnily enough my gold died to level 12 too LMAO



my 26.68 died to doggo 13



and i immediately stopped doing it



Makes sense



Dang lmao



13 over swing saves like .1 if you're lucky and .02 if you arnet



and i die doing it like 30% of the time



tbh i think doggo himself hates his 13



i will never stop doing cyclowns 29



29 wk is like .2 faster but i cant be assed



I only do wks on 29 cuz i hate turnaround grapples



and this setup that roboglues 90% of the time



the turnaround grapple method blows



either do the chad cyclowns 29 or wallkicks



yo @merpell we should do like GTAV and add a segments category, and divide it into the 5 segments



it'd be cool af



?



like this, gimme a min



segment categories

ooh yea



ok



but instead of the gta segments we have 1-10 11-20 and etc



YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



i'm about 50% sure that the only words lycro knows are "yo" and "yahoo"



KEEKEKEKEKE



its cuz i really like them



I have a recording of my 1-10 but I was recording my desktop instead of using window capture



he is mario



and i like to have my kinda signature words with any friend's group



i mean, you've never seen me and mario at the same room, did you?



exactly



how much time does fast34 (no wks) save over normal 34?



i feel like its not worth it aaaaaaaa



fastest 34 possible saves like .9



thats because it's not



fast 34 saves like .4



wtf i thought it saved like 0.7



im not doing this shit anymore



sorry scer, but you inspired me

34 just sucks



the swedish pudding stop playing for months and come back to break a wr in less than hours



no easy way to do it fast



wallkicks on 34 blow



and fast 34 makes you die a lot



Derust times are always when you get pbs aren't they
And it had fast 1 so not to impressive



i mean, I have a 40% sucess rate on them, but they're run killers for sure



no fast34 anymore



maybe i just stop doing fast 34



I held the wr for 19 minutes

{Reactions}
pogu (2) 


its just an annoying level



gives me flashbacks to my first wr



at least the 34 tas is cool



other than that yeah its ass



im testing rn



normal 34 is like 3.1



fast34 is giving me ~2:73s



fast-ish 34 is like 2.65



fastest 34 is like 2.1-2.3



double wks is like 2.2 or something



1 wk is like 2.6



no fast is giving me 3.5s cuz im not used to it :KEKW:



optimal strat is obviously 0 grapple into wallkick



i might



fuck 34



not dealing with that block



I almost died on 39 and I'm at god pace, my heart is killing me

HOW



wowwww



YOU HAVENT BEEN PLAYING PROPERLY FOR MONTHS



HOW CAN YOU BE SO GOOD



that is some baller pace



AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



nothing special even, just no deaths

{Reactions}
allegedly (3) 


casually 6s ahead of wr



CasualPudding



if i got no deaths with my strats i think my 1-40 would be like 2:19



or 2:18



sensual doesnt do races cus he wants everyone to be able to have fun

{Reactions}
monkaS 


idk how you get 2:14 like that



also 0 grapple into wk is a meme but i just got 2.58 with it



ya my 10-level golds sum to 2:14.65



understandable



0 grapple 34 isnt even that inconsistent actually



sensual bouta post a screenshot of him getting a 3:22



with practice



yea 0 grapple 34 is not bad



just have a high chance of death if u mess it up



unlike the ceiling kick



ye



I fucking can't....
My 41-50 were really bad, failed 46, 48 and 50, not deaths but slow

wait wait wait



wtf happened



you got a 27



with a 46 and 48 failure?



are you being fucking serious rn?



just slow he said



o yea that was easy 1x pace



rtd huge brain gets a 3:27.23 so sensual doesnt beat his wr the next day

{Reactions}
6head 


still insane



pbed by .59 just for this



did u record



Jeez the vid is super laggy and bad for some reason but I guess you see whats going on so

I'll upload one sec, new pb at least



do you guys maybe want 1-20, 1-30, etc. segments as well or nah



nah



idk, feels too much specific



i prefer the way it is



alright just curious



wtf strats did he do to get 2:14



still cofnused



yo sensual pls add segment option on gur trainer 4.0 🙏



7.77 type strats



so am I



cuz i do a lot of shit and my no death time for 1-40 would be like 2:17 to 2:19



its towny slide



its all towny slide



ya for me the cap's around 2:16



but i can see like 29 underswing + some optimization could get 2:14 i guess



its ALL towny slide



ngl if it wasnt by towny slide I doubt he'd have gotten a 26.53



mad lad submits the run while the video is still processing



i applaud the audacity



lmao



What do you mean?



show segment time



like if u finish 20 itll show 11-20 time



and please dont let us tas on it ffs



Ahhhh, okay



it's like a 12 min vid because I went here to share progress and shit, hope the pauses dont make it invalid



nah idgaf

i should probably record



ok il nerd



YOOOOO GRATS DOGGO \:D



i liked :d better



ASKDAKSDAKSDASD



HOLYSHIT



this run is baller



SENSUAL AT POWERFUL 3 FPS



i dont understand how wallkicks on 29 work



sensuals looked really low but mine always go really high



and it loses me a bit



to it to go low you need to wallkick high on the wall



o makes sense



yea wtf i've never gotten that low of a wk in my life



i press record and wallkicks get patched istg



sub 53 in 1-20 uhum



yeah sensual's definitively not a human



ive gotten really close to sub 53 before



a low 52 is really good though



yea i don't get how that 31-40 was so good though



i cant even tell if his 23 wk is first try cuz of the framerate



my gold has 36 wk and it's still .3 slower



bro i love how the recording becomes god tier after 1-40



23 was second try
Yeah I dont think I did anything special just all levels pretty good



YOU SPOILED IT



how was it that good with second try



makes no sense



FUCK MERPELL YOU SPOILED THE PLOT

{Reactions}
YEP 


wtf



bruh this mad lad didnt even do 46 hsg



just a confusing run



how tf was this a 3:27



who even goes for second try 23 wk



why wouldnt you



its faster than failing it and then doing the spinner of shame



after the first one you barely save time doing it again



and if you fuck it up again rip



you barely save time over not doing it at all



if you fail it once and then  get it 2nd try you save time over failing once and then just using the spinner



o did youy do 28 wk?



it looked like it



saves about as much time as 6 wk



yeah I did 28 wk, its not to bad



again, grats on the run sensual



Now I'm going to get my 3:40



until later



wish the run qualiy wasnt ass



im guessing a lot of it is just raelly optimized mvoement somehow



I'll probably run a bit in a few days and I'll fix the recording till then



sensual recorded at bad quality so no one could copy his strats and movement :6head:



sub 30 sob :pogu:

yeah its less than the minimum cap



ºoº



that's actually how a wallkick begins



oh, makes sense



now thinking about it yeah



but did it happen in this case?



i grappled at the last possible frame?



yea u can get it really easily if you're just close to something and grapple



yeah, I noticed it, in my next tries i got it a lot



I guess I didn't notice cuz i used to do the last section very slowly



I'm gonna play GUR NumLock% rn :KEKW:

pogu 


oh wait



in human benchmark you type texts



I was in 10fastfingers



where you type random words



does that slows you?



or no changes?



i think its way easier to ty pe random words



cuz in the typing sample ones you have to do punctuation and capitalziation and shit



Yeah, I'm doing worse on it :LELW:



i think avg is like 40 wpm



yeah, its on the graph



mine is 54 lmao im trash



avg is 40 cus of fucking boomers



true



on discord the average is probably closer to 70 i would think



yeah



my wpm for talking to friends and my wpm for writing essays is like way different



cuz i dont do capitalziation or punctuation or shit



and rarely correct words cuz people know what i mean



i usually just send the message then edit the typo out



especially if its like three letters back



cant be asked to fix that



i doubt i even have a tangible wpm for essay writing cus i actually think abt what i want to say



on discord i just say shit



and it works

Chokes an 8 skip on a WR pace 😦



@deleted-role How can you TAS the wk at the end of 3? Since You need to press up before you land in order to not jump when you wk, and the TAS drops extraneous input like that.



I just tried to play back my hard 3 rta but it dies because it drops all the jumps before the ground



press up the frame before you wallkick



That doesn't make you jump?



So ```
^
Z
Z
>^>>
```
?



Add another up frame to the second Z



ah



```
Z
Z^
>^>>
```
doesn't work



send the file

btw I got my first sub 6 H1 \o/



It's important to not lose/gain more than a couple frames on that 3 by doing this; I'm trying to stitch together footage of my 1-11 segmented



I know this is possible. I've done a wk like that before



I'm gonna go pass out now



yeah maistlin that 3 is fucked up



I would talk to sensual about it, maybe it's something that needs to be changed



never ran into this problem with TASing before



I've _definitely_ done a wk there without having held up beforehand



tbh its faster to ceiling kick on the right of the gap



Yeah but this is rta



ah ok



yeah that's fucky



Hard 1-11 segmented RTA

That's sub 4 total



1: 5.90
2: 3.02
3: 5.95
4: 3.83
5: 10.82
6: 5.15
7: 5.65
8: 20.65
9: 7.68
10: 5.15
11: 15.63



@SensualPudding Any chance you can get that TAS above to work without changing the pathing?



hmm, I'll take a look



I'll share the files for the sub 1:30 if anyone is interested in TASing hard mode



With this new trick a lot could be shaved of hard, like sub 1:05



sub 1 minute hard



Will share once I get some sleep though. 

I have no doubt sub 1:15 is doable,  maaaaybe sub 1



Should be good skips on H8 with the Cyclowns Hop



h8 is just gonna be like 30 swinghops to the top

What did you change? I'm not at my comp so I can't check



just did

2 is probably the same, so is 3



not even in #tas smh



Ahhhhhh that's where it goes



literally all h1-h11 is improvable but boring and long to tas



I mean strategy wise.



Yeah tas is always better at execution



3 and 8 might be the only levels that would utilize the hop



Wait 9 too



why 3?



🤦



6 and 7 definitely can



if you use it right



Meant to say 1



Where?



idk im just envisioning it in my brain



You don't need extra height though



6 so you can go over the entire last swing



you can get better angles with it not just height



swinghops can give you more horizontal speed than swinging



Swinging is faster than running though



see: 15 16 19 33



Lol my phone thinks that's a phone number



@Towny you should probably upload the tas



like right now?



I could



i mean yea you said definitely weekend



and it isnt gonna be weekend for very long

23 seconds :KEKW:



wouldve been 12 without 45 btw



yeah seriously



ah true



didnt think about 45



bro that 11



i love how stupid it is



yet it only saves like 0.08



legendary



that 15-20 yummy



fr the dumbest strats got pulled out to save less than .1 each



was that 23 really necessary



32 also



how many inputs are there in 23?



23 and 32 are like tied for the 5th longest level so yea



40 :lul:



rip towny slide :YEPsad:

lmao loved 32



the TAS is really beatiful to see



32 is my only direct contribution to the tas



and i am proud of it



I coulda sworn you helped out more



i never did any tasing



just ideas and shit



says you authored 3 levels?



i gave him 16 out of pity



doggo put me as author for 16 cuz that was like my whole idea



i did tasing for 36 and 44 but neither made it in to tas cuz they werent as fast



I literally only said an obvious strat for 49 that someone would've said in 2 minutes and kinda got in there :KEKW:



almost sub 1 minute 1-30



lmao



you guys are insane with these strategies



:POGGERS:



that 29 is underappreciated



o yea it's one of my favs



question, does anyone have the level split times for the original tas



i wanna make like a tas comparison synced by level



my favorite part about 11 is it looks like you miss the block and fail at first



and yes i do cyclowns



I'll send them to you



also could use the uncompressed tas videos but i could just dl it from youtube



here are the first TAS times

@Towny How did you record the TAS run and have it show the timer and end game screen?



Whenever TAS mode is enable, it doesn't show that



version of gurtrainer that has it



modified for recording tas



it was a special version that only me and sensual have



and maybe ero



Oh. I want to record my segmented hard mode run



Can I send it to you and have you do it?



Talk to sensual. I think he wanted to keep it under wraps because it's easy to cheat with it, but he probably trusts you



or yeah I could record it for you



Yeah I totally understand



I can record it tomorrow if you want



I totally support not sharing it with anyone.



Im surprised he even shared it with me



towny known cheater



Honestly, it should just be enabled but have some sort of affordance that shows it's a tas



Like a T before the time or something



@Towny can you send me a recording that I can upload to YT?

nvm



something very very odd happened



?



so with sensuals custom exe, it requires that all files be given one extra frame at the begining... for whatever reason. And for whatever reason hard 8 is the only level that doesn't require one



huh



sensual hacker confirmed



okay, recording it now

Hyped for towny x rtd



dont put x that makes it sound like a ship



Wait when was merpxcyclowns



today



Jk lov u towny



i raced doggo then raced merpell



What time?



idk



like 3 pm



I was probably asleep



Wait wut didn't know that



like ten hours ago



I slept from like 9am to 5pm

lycro its v



rtd v towny



yeah if you put x it sounds romantic



or sexual



xoxo



sexualpudding



😳



idk x sounds cool



I know, but I didn't know that x makes it sounds romantic, like, thinking about it now makes sense



i mean it does



merpell xersus cyclowns



~~towny x rtd would be more hype but thats besides the point~~



all im saying is i did propose to merpell during the race



:POGGERS:



i do not remember this



oh yeah the "keep it in the ring" part



someone said something like "theyre gonna meet in the ring"
and i said like "yeah im gonna give merpell the ring, on one knee"



:peepoLove:



Btw when is the race going to occur?



next weekend

Gay wedding! Gay wedding!!! Poggies!!!

then maybe another



right



i think so



we can barely make this a fall tournament



first two are bo5, last race is bo7



Noice



damn bo7



i will simply beat rtd/towny 5-0 twice in a row

6head (3) 


cyclowns gets to win 3 times in a row vs towny then 4 times in a row vs rtd



wait bo7 is to 4



nvm



i will add a pity round and then win that too



you'll win so hard you get a technical round



like you ever play a game with a little kid and they think theyre gonna win and then u bust their ass



i gotta be toxic before the match because my anxiety will make me nontoxic



those kids gotta learn young

i havent lost a race in my wife either



:monkagiga:



me neither

allegedly (2) 


if I had a wife but if I did I'd never lose in her



pretend I typed that right



i have 17 wives



for tax purposes



lmao you pay taxes



not after i got 17 wives



if you break the high score they just dont make you pay taxes



you ever have delirious stream of consciousness word barf at 1 am



Stonks📈📈📈



thats what i mgoing through right now



does the government pay you if you get 18?



its exponential



if you have 22 wives you accrue approximately 18 billion dollars in revenue



this also applies to husbands no discrimination here



What if they coincidentally die 2 days later?



All of them



Coincidentally



then you have to immediately pay the IRS 18 billion dollars



good luck



God damn the wives must be protected



But what if they are already dead?



well you cant half ass your wife



not if i move to venezuela with 18 billion cash up my ass



Only a hypothetical situation (shhhh)



Well, by my maths 18bi dollars equal to



18 billion dollars is equivalent to just about 7 mud pies



so it evens out



35828369269e3582582692682585826925725925726936 bolivars



Which can sustain you for about 2 and a half day



heres my scheme



i will cause inflation so bad in the U.S. that the dollar count goes above the 64 bit floating point number maximum



and rolls back to negative infinity



and then everyone dies



ngl if I die too I'll get something out of this



So I'm down



How can I help



well we'll need a lot of printers



first he needs 5 more wives



Hmmmmm I have two that only work 40% of the time



For no reason too



yea good enough



They just don't work



And I have approximately



13 wives



Half are on hospital tho



Does it count?



im gonna print out a 100$ bill on computer paper and hand it to a clerk in 7/11 and when they call the police i'll twiddle my moustache, go 'DRATS' and run out devilishly



that's the scheme



how does one acquire 22 wives? just show them your give up robot speedrun?



Okok, liked the plan



yeah obviously



Going to start printing more wives



BRB



i showed my 1st wr to my girlfriend on our 1st date and we've been tog ether for 2 years



coincidence?



Chad movement right here



i gotta hit sub 4 before i can do all that



I believe on you patrick



i dont think my 1st wr was even sub 4



yea it was like 4:00.500 or something



You just need some more wives and you're done to get that sub4



i'm at 4:20 rn



all you gotta do is beat arcanods time



seems perfect



and then you are sent a check for 5 million dollars

SMH



Loved talking more about our plan to take over the world economy



little known clause in the social security act



Promise you I'll have about 35~ wives by tomorrow



anyone that beats arcanods time gets 5 million dollars and a baskin robbins gift card



Where's my 5mil



they forgot about that part



I only got a let's go by my brother

that makes sense why moving blocks change color then



It does, and it's actually quite brilliantly designed aswell, because you avoid having to make thousands of blocks, but instead you make a 7-piece pattern and just have a valueless block you fill in all the places you want them to be



wait hold up, I need that line in the document

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/788900885342322688/The_color_pattern_of_Give_up.pdf



There you go



updated version



100 times better



I'm not sure the blocks are in that form factor. I think it's a line of 7 blocks in the code
But interesting non the less



no its like that in the images



Yeah there are many ways you can make the pattern



the reason i did it in the 











shape



was so it was more intuitive to put the nextblock



because you wouldn't no the next step if it was just 



but as long as you have the 7 different colors connected you can have many different forms



Yo @SensualPudding will the Level Creator have an mappack function? Like, make various levels together like an mini mode



?

Can someone tell me what the hell in the world is that new pulling trick in the last tas?



stupid is what it is



the cyclowns fling



lol



It's called a swinghop. Basically you set up your grapple to be longer than the maximum length, then press down to enforce the cap, and release the grapple to capture the momentum



it's like a wallkick but with max grapple instead of minimum grapple



alternatively, the cyclowns slingshot



the cyc launch if you will



That's cool yall cool



watch me call it Cyc launch



the only time i will ever consistently use capital letters purely out of spite



cyc launch is actually a good name



i prefer merpellaunch personally



Well done cyc



pansear  launch



choose your character launch



Lol



ive spent sooo much time into optimixign it it derseves to br named after me



funnylaunchman



true



pansear tas'ed the 45 ending



spread the word



you guys have broken this damn game



hey we still do all 50 levels



^



for now



thats more than you can say for a lot of games



i only know 11 levels



facts



i only know 1 level bc i keep resetting on it



:peepoSad:



i relate



Yeah I kinda gave up on it, so don't really have to expect nothing because nothing will come for a while sorry. Missa to stooopid



F for flash after december

I'm still in denial

had the grappl not extended I'd have proceeded and gotten it



i dont get why people cant clutch out runs



like



just dont die



🤔



this is litteraly a game mistake



you can see i release



but nothing happens



complete bs



just missed the frame



unlucky



It happened to me sometimes, it happens when you release for a very very low time



In mine the key mapping thing showed as I released, but the game didn't



Cuz it was so little



you just gotta do the cyclowns 50



no one understands



just do the cyclaunch 5head



i think i have the most unique 50



no one does the last 3 pillars as weirdly as i do but ive also never seen anyone do the first lava pillars how i do it



i think you have the best 29



no contest



the merpell 29



the maistlin-cyclowns-merpell 29



pansear 37



I GOT TO LVL 50 AT 3:21 AND CHOKED THE HSG

welcome



hi 😁 !



how can we do custom levels ? is it out ?



theres a beta version of gurtrainer that can kind of do custom levels



you can make custom levels by just editing the level files directly which can be found here <https://github.com/cyclowns/gur-decompiled/tree/master/binaryData>



but to actually play them you need to get someone to edit them into an swf or use the gurtrainer beta thing



oki thx you

The best part of Tazdrongo GUR reverseWR is that he stops for half second every level to react and remember how to pass them



reverse wr :lul:

This guy is a legend



he's a fellow aussie dog cunt... I love him



:peepoLove:



:cheesed: I would be most cheesed to meet him one day



Yo imma invite him to the discord



Through yt and SRC lol



I wonder if he'd ever want to pick up GUR again



Idk let's try



Yo how do I get the perma link



I think he may try it, idk, he seems very careless so probably not but I'd be cool



perma links in the TAS description I think



Ok lemme see



Yo guess who's getting free nitro from xbox game pass tomorrow B)



#imalmostahobo



:POGGERS:



i dont have xbocks :dab:



and i also dont want nitro



i dont get the point



You can post POGSLIDE



also :towny:



Nitro is totally not worth 10 bucks



if its free then i guess why not



*Maybe* 5 but I'd still not buy it



its not worth the 100$ a year or whatever



Totally not worth it



But for free I'd get even an polio Iron lung



yeah fuck it why not



become a cyborg



:pogu:



Joined the server.



whats up fuckers



:POGGERS:  Tazdrongo



i am the fabled 85th place give up robot man



Whats up man



im HN  Films now



how are there 85 runs



wtf



i never said i was last place



I liked your once upon a time in hollywood review. Very poignant and informed



thx



technically not the slowest run submitted to give up robot 1 speedrun.com



did u see my mario speedrun



Of course lol



the honor goes to TheJdawg https://www.speedrun.com/gur1/run/m7pdlg5m



no ones submitted a >10 minute time somehow



ok i will



can you accept a submitted run thats slower than that persons pb



good question



if not, reject the last one for cheating and accept the new, uncheated pb



true



towny how did u find my speedrun now



now that runs >5 mins dont need video  everyone can just submit their 50 minute casual runs



weird cos i was considering doing a new speedrun



I watch all the Give up robot speedruns, and usually sub to everyone



wait so i can say i got a run thats 5 mins and 1 second weithout proof?



you need screenshot proof



You need a screenshot



just not video



picture of the end screen



photoshop



does it specify what kind of screenshot



can i take a picture from across the room with my phone camera and then submit the time incorrectly



so that merpell has to csi enhance and figure out what time it was



its stupidly hard to fake the end screenshots



without directly modifying the game in some way



take a screenshot, print it out and mail it to merpell



the colors do make it hard



ive tried



its actually hard as shit



give up robot's aesthetic makes bitrate shit but it makes cheating basically impossible



i think splicing runs is legitimately not possible without some insane effort



I'd say the easiest way would be get a reasonable 1-50 time but for 1-10, then wait for the color frame, and shop the time



i am going to speedrun google snake game



and then for the score ??



youd have to use the score calc then manually put in every number



true, didn't think of that



using the same method



where is my role



true give him absolute legend



:+1:



you are a bit of a legend around here



yay



wait who is this again



in the next week i will have a new run



tazdrongo



the easiest way to cheat an end screenshot is to just modify the swf



which is not difficult



last place holder



name aounds faimilar



oo yeah



The guy with the ASMR pb :lul:



the  9 minute whatever ?



9:24 or 9:28



cant remember



9 24



my first  goal when i started running



getting a run that wouldnt be last place



last place is a sign of strength



84th is beating me by 5 seconds



word record is like 8:5x right



word record is definitely 8 minutes



isnt there some dumb  getting over it  category where the slowest time gets first place



world record is 9 mins 24 seconds 120ms



word



not world



yes but word record

isnt it like fourth to last



i will do a practice



:POGGERS: LETS GOOOO



cyclown  who is your profile picture



molly millions



from neuromancer



o



neuromancer sounds  familiar i think  but idk what it is



adobe flash is blocked



its begun



it probably sounds familiar bc of necrodancer



flash is dead



long live flash



@HN Films you can download a standalone flash player from the SRC resource page



how tf do i play then



ok



i mean you sohuld be able to play just fine



right now



We're releasing an .exe version soon



is the swf player on the resources page



it only dies in like a week or two



it should be



or just the .swf's



both are cause i remember asking merpell to change it to the debug versin

merpell is ancient



kek



give up robot players during world war 1 when they found a swf player: yooooo



so we've found 2 of the 3 absolute legends. All we need is arcanod now, and we complete the trinity



we could get some side characters too



the first one was  maistlin ?



btspider and jumpyluff come to mind



yes pansear



I mean, merpell knows jumpyluff



jumpyluff is  active on discord right?   im not sure



I thought he was in the server already



i think hes just an active on src in general



jumpyluff did some celeste speedrunning



he has a time on the gur board



i think its like six mins



yeah



and he used to be a mod

HE READ MY COMMENT YAHOOO



sup man!



ohh so hn is tazdrongo?



and yo guess who has nitro now :FeelsGoodMan:



i was wondering why he was absolute legend



for free obviously



for obvious reasons



Who’s tazdrongo?



how dare you disgrace the name of the former 69th place new game runner



Due to insufficient knowledge and research I recall and apoligize for any defamation felt by HN films who undoubtly deserves the the title Absolute Legend



Hello I just got some problems with LiveSplit. How do we start it ?



Joined the server.



O



Hi



hiii



I'm currently 44th on the leader board and I wanna move up. Any tips?



I'm currently 44th on the leader board and I wanna move up. Any tips?



Maybe you don't have the correct version of Flash player, was something about the correct version. I don't know much about it but you can ask any of the other mods, someone should know



Hello Icecube welcome



Well, practice is important



Yeah



50 blockless is a good save to practice too when you're a bit higher but for now I'd just play and improve slightly



Yeah



on livesplit you need 50 splits and you also have to compare to game time, for the flashplayer you need to be using flashplayer_32_sa.exe



I did practice that but I always die when I get there on a real run lol



use GUR trainer to train the levels you find difficult



The timings are very precise



and then when you have a good run



Ok



start practising some minor skips



so do we bro its a tough one



like practicing the HSG



hello! whats ur time?



and then use it for 24



and see how you can progress



Also will emulators be unbanned when flash shuts doen



emulators are not really banned



My time is 5. 20



they're banned on the site so you cant submit under emulator



but its all the same game



I thought it was banned cos u can easily hack on an emulator



Idk any gur hacks tho



you can use a TAS on GUR trainer



but GUR trainer cant be used as a way to submit runs



we all use swf files of the game



I use browser I'm noob lol



which we play in an adobe debugger software



Ok



yo, the non-debug one is actually better



but that doesn't make that of a difference



but yo ice



what do you use lycro?



Can use livesplit on the non debug one so I'd go for that



Tbh the best I can do with computers is get mods minecraft lol



for your current pb, i recommend: learning 24 HSG, copying the current 11-20 on the top3 (its very easy and saves some valuable seconds) learning fast 29 (no wallkicks) fast 36



Do u know any sites that are safe to download swf files fprm



and about fast50, you could start doing it rn to get better at it, but I'd not recommend doing until you have a 4;30~



speedrun.com



thx you mate



imo these are easy strats that saves loads of time



you'll get a 4:25 in not time doing them, believe me



fast 29 is not easy



what software is used to run swf files



honestly i would not recommend



it's all in the resources section on speedrun.com



I mean, no wallkicks or that crazy setup that merpell and some guys here do



the software is Adobe Flash Player



just the normal one with the turnaround grapple



Ok



yea even that one



cuz it'll improve his overall control



and if I'm not mistaken I did that on my 6 minute run back in the day



so I believe he can do it



Thx for helping a noob out



i didn't do fast 29 until i had like a 4x or sth



to be fair it wasn't widely known but still



let ice determine, maybe he cant do it, maybe he can, i did not watch his run yet



I think fast 29 is really hard
Skipped learning it because wk is faster anyway



i mean, its not easy by any means, but if he learns it kinda early he may get better at it since soon



I regret taking so long to do fast50, it made my fast50 be really trash (and still is :KEKW: )



Does anyone have any tips for flinging urself up on lvl 24



I suck at it



grab the 2nd block on the lower part



so you have more time retracting and timing to release the grapple



if your grapple is not extending when you go under the first block, you need to take a little longer before going under



Didn't rtd make a vid explaining HSG on some levels long ago?



yeah he did



lemme link it just a min



I just don't know when to let go of the arrows keys to fling up



you dont need to let go of the arrow keys, just of Z



Oh



but to get the timing, watch some runs



I'm normally good at timings cos I play geometry dash but with this it's a different story lol



and see when they release it



Yeah



experience :pogu:



Haha lol



yea u can watch my vid but to add sth i'd recommend waiting a bit once u swing back under the first block



definitely helps consistency



the rest is the same tho



I sent the timing slightly luck based



i dont think so



its a 6 frame window



after some time becomes muscle memory



not luck based at all

I'd say my 24 HSG consistency its like 90% so not luck based at all



it will become muscle memory very quickly



plz dont even bother 43 and 46 HSG by now



but 24 is almost obligatory for any time really



yeah i got a 3:43 with only 24 and fast 50+hsg

{Reactions}
😳 


so you dont need crazy strats to be fast



24 cyclaunch

There's an explanation for them in the description



i commented on one of those



do yall do that in RTA



HSGs are commonly done RTA



and wallkicks to a lesser extent



ok



> lesser extent
depends on who youre asking



pretty sure there was a time where rtd did more wallkicks per run than hsg



and cser obviously does



I meant less people do them



oh fair



but yeah it's to the point where like RTD does more wallkicks than hsgs probably



rtd does uhh



hsg in 24 40 43 46 50 sometimes 45
wk in 6 22 23 29 32 sometimes 34 36



mario



its named after wallkicks in mario 64 yeah



mario



cus towny is culturally appropriating mario



I have no clue how this happened

Nice! You got tha bounce



??



horseshoe grapple rng



you are simply good at the game



ah okay



Wait wtf happended there



Kinda confused ngl



Sometimes when you release a grapple you get a small vertical bounce



it seems completely random



yea still got no explanatiopn



its the reason wallclimbing is a thing



and seemingly part of why 48 is so inconsistent



yup



Hmmmmmmmm we still didn't finish discovering everything this game has to offer



Yo, merpell I remember you talking about why you didn't like playing GUR with red switches, can you tell me why didn't you like it?



Im thinking about buying a linear switch (red or black) cuz I already have a blue and heard that linears are better for gaming, but they usually say that counting only FPS games



if someone can try and tas a weird grapple boost like that itd be helpful



maybe on 20 or 48



or trying to wallclimb



hi i use emulator now it runs alot smoother i like to use gur trainer  too



Which emulator?



That was on gur trainer so I can send the tas file later



@Towny just the general fl;ash one on resources



ohhh gotcha

@LycroP2 because there isn't any physical feedback as to when you've pressed the key, so it's very difficult to make precise inputs



oooooh make sense



You'd love a tactile switch then



I wouldn't call it an emulator but I see what you're saying



i use dolphon emulator to play luigis mansion and its pretty similar



its not an emulator
its just running flash without a browser



similar tho



looks aalmost exactly the same as the emulators i use



its the same thing as playing in a website, the web site also uses a flash player



the difference is that there's nothing between you and the game, while playing in the browser you have the website in between your inputs



flash wont be allowed in most browsers soon will it?



causing lag and delay sometimes



it'll be discontinued



sad



Guys



How do I get the swf file for give up robot



Can you give me a link to the direct file?



Just click on resources in speedrun. Com



it's on the speedrun.com resources page

Has anyone got any tips for doing the level 50 trick consistently



nobody here can do it consistently lol



bar maybe cyclowns



cyclowns overrated

{Reactions}
KEKW (2) 


but getting it consistent enough isnt much more than just grinding it on gur trainer



I always get stressed at level 50 and end up doing  the normal way



i was like that for a while



I feel like it's not worth the eisk



then i beat my pb by like eight seconds on a god awful run bc i did 50 skip as a last resort and got it first try



its extremely worth it



more worth it than any other trick



well its less worth than like 48 skip



but yea its hard to do it with any kind of consistency



i guess thats true



well 48 requires virtually zero risk



Cos when I get a good run my I just panic and go normal



fast 50 saves like 10-12 seconds



i wann say



just get a run that you know probably cant pb to 50 and then do 50 skip



I've got rly consistent at the level 24 glitch



if you get it, free pb
if you dont, run was dead if you did it normally anyway



with the hsg you can save roughly 14s versus normal 50



just dont reset as often when you start doing fast 50



if you have a run thats like 5 seconds behind when you get to 50 then it can still pb by a lot



if you get fast 50



so jsut be more lenient



Yeah



I went form 5. 20 to 5.15



that said, the best way to save teim when your time isnt below like 4:30



is to just not die as muych



I wasn't that proud originally but it bumped me up the leaderboard



yeah i got a 4:18 with seven deaths and no 50 skip



Ooh



so just being good is enough until youre around top 15



Also does anyone know how to fullscreen when using swf



being able to do 24 hsg with that time is pretty impressive



alt+enter



if you want real fullscreen



Thx



i just maximize the window



I used ctrl f



But the black thing was still there



So thx



but yea the main timesave is just not dying



i had a 4:30 with no 50 skip and like a dozen or more deaths probably



and my really old 4:00.35 had 50 skip but no 24 hsg



Just a random question does anyone remember how long it took them to beat the game for the first rime



For me it was like 20 mins



mine too



first time was like 21 minutes or somethign



I remember spending ages on level 50



I think level 50 took me like 10 mins



oh i was very bad at games when i first tried it



Same



i remember speedrunning 1-49 bc i couldnt do 50 after like half an hour



I was 6 or something when I first tried it



my worst level was 42



cuz i would do the last segment really weirdly



no jump?



where i wouldnt jump over this bit

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/789998539760992301/unknown.png



yea



i would tryand like cut a line perfectly



Same



I hated that part



And I knew jumping was an option but I was too stubborn to try



and then one of my friends was like 'cant you just jump' and i felt like a dumbass



That level still gives me nightmares



Also yknow level 32



I recently found out that there's a way to skip it



yeah just wallkick



32?



i dont remember 32 being like difficult



i was asleep during almost the entire discovery of wallkicks



and i just wake up



check this discord



the first thing i see is the video of 32 skip



in my old speedruns when arcanod still had wr I used to die to 41 so many times



like 80% of deaths in my run were to 41



doggo must've felt like: how did we get here?



I am going to lose my mind

the one I used di not have it



but, how  do I make so livesplit appears on top still?



when you press alt+enter



i spent so many time without it ;-;



damn debug



@Daveed dont post your segments during the run or ill drive over and make you lose the run

cuz rn I cant see them in full screen ;-;

playing GUR doesnt make me happy anymore
playing GUR just makes me smash my monitor because I released a button 20ms early and that cost me 5 secs



I still love this shit, but fuck this shit



take a break then



if i get burnout or stop enjoying something i just quit it for however long it takes



I JUST CHOKED ANOTHER 50 AT 3:33 PACE



what



Hi



U could play gur 2 as a break ik its not as good tho



Good job on the pb @Daveed !



Joined the server.



Hi



Hey 👋



does anyone have any tips on speedrunning?



Tons



anything in particular?



mainly level 50



I would say just practice a shit ton



use the GUR trainer



its a hacked swf with level select



ik



you trying to do it without the block? or with the block



with



Which part do you fail the most?



the bit where you have to wait



and then get back on to the block



Yeah thats the toughest bit I think



I would say try to get yourself as close to the block as possible before grappling



maybe set up a visual cue for when to hit the spinner so you'll get more consistent timing



thats a good idea



Also this may be obvious, but you can jump at any time on those falling platforms to make them fall faster



ik



you on the leaderboard? Whats your pb



not yet



I'm trying



Good luck man!



Thx



Thx for the advice too!



any time

Does anyone have any tips for level 44?



Which part are you struggling on?



All of it



walk off the edge and grab the pillar, then swing while you shorten the line a little, then fall into the hole between the next lava pillat and the 3 steps, fly away and grab the 2nd block, then you are at the finish

trying to do this game blindfolded mightve been a mistake



i got consistent setups for 1-5



Blindfolded??!!!



How are people so good at this games



i didnt make any progress



i was just trying to find setups



Oh



If u did it blindfolded that would be nuts



Also my official goal for this game is to pass the Welsh guy so then I'm best in my county



39 42 and 45 are all levels



so a full blind run probably wont happen



Imagine doing the level 50 skip blindfolded



It would be hard, but possible



Sync up cues with the music



Yh



yeah 4 has a very consistent music cue



i havent gotten one for 6 but it probably exists



but 6 is a lot more granular than i gave it credit for



I've seen a vid of a person doing really hard geometry dash levels blindfolded and he used the music as a cue



the 3 setup has a wallkick btw lol



wayyy more consistent than actually doing the level



Also does anyone have any tips for level 29



I think it's 29

Here's a tip: Learn the Towny Slide. Free half a second time save



> free



Literally the easiest trick in the game



thats why you talk about dropping it so much



Yeah cause it's too easy. The game isn't even a challenge with it



ofc



Yeah that one



TEACH. ME. HOW. TO. DO. THIS. GOD. DAMN. LEVEL



for real though, try to hit the platform while still attached to the spinner, instead of trying to fling yourself to the platform



like, extend on the spinner so you hit the platform while still spinning



48 has entered the chat



Thx I'll try it



oh shit i mightve found a consistent way to time 39 blindfolded LOL

hello



whats this game



Hey hoodie



i decided to find something to speedrun



hello



It's a cool flash game



wheres the link



this game is a platformer where you have a grapple to move yourself around the levels



oooh



sounds fun

You can download the SWF there



you can download the swf file and the flash player in the link towny sent



then you just need OBS to record and you're done \:D



can i use a windows recorder



its like



the best



As long as the gameplay is recorded yeah



ok



imma practice



Actually times above 5 minutes only need a screenshot



but video proof is encouraged by the verification team



ie merpell



ok



Good luck! There's a practice SWF on the resource page too, with level select



have you finished the game casually before?



im gonna try and get at least 10th



ok



no



so



I'd recomemend finishing the game first



aight



for any gane really



playing a game for the frist time with the only reason to be fast is not cool



talking from experience



but, gl with your playthrough, im sure you'll like this amazing game ^^



just a question



how did you find Give Up Robot speedruns and why do you want to try it?



speedrun.com discord



but how did you find us in SRC



I posted the tournament thing there



OOOOOOOOOOOOOH



can't post it on reddit though for some reason, so someone else has to do that



im so ba

it's okay you just started



jokes aside, dont worry about it now, just try to play and get the feel of the game and its mechanics



sensual with the hype src discord strats



love to see it



welcome hoodie



ok



hi



how do u mad lads do it in 20 second



1-10?



i mean



yeah



typo lol



I'd recommend after you beat the game casually watch the 10-15th place runs



cuz i think they have the most notable tricks



and a gameplay that you can copy, but a little slower since you're just starting



ok



but, if you think thats too hard for you yet, see other runs



watch arcanod



he's the og



arcanod's 4:06.03 is also a good bet



Watch TownyTV



no hard tricks



yeah, arcanod is a good one thats shows how just clean gameplay can carry you long



but it doesnt have any of the big timesaves we use now



with some strats  a deathless run  with fast movement could get you to like  a low 4 probably



ok



i could probably get a 4:1x right now if i just got a run without any mistakes



I'd only recommend you doing 24 HSG and copying the top level 1-20



maybe an even lower time than that



thats a good starting point



but finish the game casually first



panser sub 4  when



when

YIKES



playing blindfolded is pretty fun if you're allowed to skip the autoscrollers and reset



39 has a consistent enough strat



havent tried any of the other autoscrollers



ive done everything up to 38 fine and dandy



i imagine 41-50 is hell



but maybe not if you exclude 42, 45, 50



as do i



48



48 is short enough



do you think you can skip the autoscroller blindfolded



on 48?



yes



sure



let me try



but yeah for 39 you can hold right until you hit a wall, tap left and wait for a set of 4 measures in the song to start



then grapple, wait 3 measures and move left every beat on the 4th



then wait another 4 measures and move right every three eights notes



and youll make it to the end after five of those



gur is now a rhythm game



thats what half the blindfold strats come down to yeah



got 48



took me like 20 attempts probably

49 is surprisingly hard



49 would probably need a music cue yeah



spinners in general suck



thats why my 7 strat is so weird



ive been doing it without music



just sound cues and counting in my head



im trying to get 46 hsg blindfolded which is pain



i could probably just turn on a metronome



i got 46 hsg



ive beaten every level except 39, 42, 45 50 now



blindfolded



39 is possible apparently



45 is probably the easiest of those bunch



42 and 50 seem extraordinarily hard



i would imagine 42 has consistent music cues



since theres no grappling



i would definitely need some rhythm for 42



i can stream the 39 strat



and attempts at finding a 42 strat



45 and 50 are gonna suck ass

havent done it blindfolded but it works for me



crazy



i found a normalized setup to get onto the same point on the 45 block every time so that much shouldn't be an issue



should we make like a #blindfolded channel



id rather not unless we know its not gonna die in like two days



but i dont care much either way



ok mightve gotten a consistent 45 strat lemme try it blindfolded



worked first try but died after getting to the ceiling lol



my 42 strat will work its just still reallyt fucking hard



id imagine



so 39 42 45 all theoretically possible



50, idk



i tried for 10min and could barely make it past the first pillars



god fuck the part of the song thats just a beat off sync for no reason

the swing that looks tight is as tight as it looks



theres probably a more consistent strat



but this works



Joined the server.



sup



a clean 44 seconds



better than 25 seconds with four deaths



whats the hardest strat we can do blindfolded



22 ceiling kick?



i was thinking that



its easy to do if you take your time



so its not that bad for blindfold



probably more consistent than going across



cus almost no timing involved



and if you dont get it dying is fast



2 wk 22



blindfolded



simple



you can do wk strats in 21 actually



a wallkick on the wall that the spinner is on puts you at the exact spot to grapple the spinner



i tried to get 24 hsg and couldnt get it



but i did get 43 and 46 and those are harder so 24 is definitely possible



only problem is theres no feedback as to whether you hit the hsg



or whether you get roboglued



11-20 is pretty free



11 is actually sorta hard



sans 15 and 20



15?



16 was sorta hard for me



and 20 wasnt super easy



16 is fuckupable but fairly consistent



15 literally doesnt have a setup unless it involves a death



15 is just muscle memory



its like a 2 second level



you just go and if you grapple then you wn



fair



has anyone got any tips for lvl 41 it really pisses me off while speedrunning and adds 10 seconds



Don't try to slam dunk it, grapple the top right lava and swing through



ok will try



pain

Hlo!



Hello monke



Whats ur time?



Hello! I submitted a run recently at 6m 43s and 680ms, but the leaderboard hasn’t been updated.



My previous run was 7m 33s 820ms tho



Nice!



you can  just say 6:43.68 and 7:33.82



For now I recommend just playing more and get used to the game physics



When you feel fine start to learn the simpler strats, like HSG on easier levels



Feel free to ask anything



Thank you! I think a lot of it for me right now is consistency. I’ll go through the levels, but get hung up on ones that I usually have no problem with and vice versa. There’s a bunch of glitches I saw that were crazy, but as you said, I’m focused on learning the game more than that right now.



The only thing I'd say to you to start getting good now is doing 1-20 just like top level runners, you'll start a little less precise and slower but it'll help you a lot to shave some seconds in the long run



I can do that. I’m still practicing 1, 18, and 20 to get them consistent. What’s an ideal time for level 1?



6 is good starting point



Even 6.5 for starters



I play this game for like an year and I still get high 4s



:KEKW:  not proud tho :YEPsad:



Lmao. That’s still a decent time. I have trouble getting it under 10s... Once I learn that one, 2-10 is easy.



Yeah, sometimes 3 will piss off but do not stop the grind!



But seriously, by now, care more about your late game



Your late game can save much more than your early game



I have 16 secs of timeloss in my 41-50 on my PB



Just so you have an idea



If you look at my 6 min time a while ago and compare it to my 5 min you'll see how much time I saved just in 41-50



And it was still very improvable



I’ve noticed that too! Sometimes I’ll have an abysmal first half, but if I get through the last 10 with minimal deaths, it saves it.



Exactly



That’s how my most recent one happened.



Deaths on later levels lose much more time over deaths and mistakes than earlier ones



Can relate



also deaths in earlier levels make you more likely to reset



so a run that makes it to 40 is more likely to have been good up until that point



Lmao. 42 wrecked me for the longest time.



But then you learn you can just jump



When my friend told me you could just jump at the end I looked at myself just like :PepeHands:



Wow that was a long time ago wtf



I usually keep a maximum on my times for certain sections. Like if I don’t make the first ten levels in under 40s I reset and so on.



I remember when I used to race my friend at school and we used to get like 11 minutes



That's a good starting point! But you get yourself resetting too much, continue anyways



I used to reset too much, and it made my late game bad af



i just reset when i get frustrated



I think my first completion of give up robot had like 78 minutes lmao.



failing 23 wallkick five times probably wastes more time than a 24 death but a 24 death makes me more frustrated



so im more likely to reset on that



Lmao, my friend took 107 mins :KEKW:



I 100% relate to this shit



I took 37 and like 10 min were on 50



The wall kick intrigues me lol. I don’t plan on doing it any time soon but I haven’t found any guides for it. I still have no clue how it’s done.



go against a wall    hold up    press grapple for exactly two frames



they take a while to get used to but when you do theyre pretty helpful



The way it works is that the grapple has a minimum length when trying to make it smaller, so the game pushes you off the wall to make the normal length, but if you ungrapple during the push you go BRRRRRRRRRRRR and boom you flied through the level kek



like you can wallkick through the second section of 29 and its both faster and more consistent than grappling the ceiling of the first section to go through (the other fast strat)



But if you don't do it first try you lose some ms



way less timeloss than dying to underswing



Yeah, that's why I do it



theres virtually no risk of death with 29 wk



I hate underswing



Oh! That’s... far less than what I thought it was. Thank you! I will keep all of that in mind.



Fuck underswing all my homies hate underswing



yeah the glitches we have arent too complicated



Yep!



the most complicated one is probably hsg



Do you understand HSG already?



which was the first one to be discovered



By the legendary budderlord



Is that the one like on 24 where you can slingshot yourself?



yep



Yep



I don’t know how it works, but I know of it’s existence.



It's not that hard really



Lemme explain



Sorry if I didn't explain it clearly



> you can make it longer than the max cap
50 hsg disproved that this was the reason a very long time ago



Wait what



Explain me so



Sorry for the bs then but I'm curious



it doesnt have anything to do with max length



I thought that 50 worked cuz the game added the speed cuz it was trying to make your grapple as it should be



Longer



So it gave u speed



when you make the grapple shorter the game wants to move you in a straight line from your position to where the grapple connects



same goes for making it longer but vice versa



hsg happens when it cant do that



it is partly how 24 works



with max length



e.g. in 24 hsg the game wants to move the grapple up and right while contracting, but because of the ceiling it can only move you right



then when it can move you up again it freaks out and moves you up super fast



Oh HSG is more complex than I thought



Sorry for talking bs



No worries! That was my best guess too 😛



: P



I hate that :/



Put a / before the emote



you can just turn it off



i forget where it is



°o°



(^-^)



/:D and :D



It doesn't work on cellphone



The emotes



its under user settings -> text & images



Oh, I'll change that later



Thanks for the tip



but yeah the max grapple thing was the theory for a while



which is weird bc the first instance of it was 20 and 20 hsg obviously had nothing to do with max grapple



So technically I'm not wrong, I'm just not updated



:KEKW:



youre wrong but so was everyone else



When was it discovered the right reason?



Of how the HSG really works



dunno



i came up with the explanation i gave myself



But like,  6 or 3 months?



hsg was known for like a while



im pretty sure i was the first to explain it



Yeah, but when the right reason of it working was developed?



Anyways, I should be more updated before explaining it, sorry u-u



No worries! Now ya know /:D



Is this the first tourney to have prizes for winners?



yeah



Who is the sponsor for this one?



no idea



towny inc.



the townytv memorial fund



i will kill townytv and use his life insurance



exactly



lol



prize pools reportedly set to increase exponentially



townytv fall 2021 tournament 1st place price exceeds the GDP of costa rica



so like 5k?

there we go



Random question how long has everyone here been playing for



like three years but extremely on and off



I played when it came out in 2010, But I've only been speedrunning for about 9 months



About 5-6 years but a huge break in the middle



Started more actively in 2020 sometime



About a week.



Speedrunning for a week, but I beat it once or twice before that.



since 2016



but I've only come back 1 or 2 months ago



since last year, but stopped at the start of this year and came back in june i think



I played the game for a few months in 2016, but I've only been speedrunning the game for about 2 months



just under  two months



but that was only ILs



full game runs was  probably like 1.5 months ago



I started around 2013



like 3 years but yeah very on and off



i started playing it in like middle school but i didnt do runs



only started runs 2 years ago



I started runs around a year ago



Still got a lot of work to do on my runs but ngl since I flunked a pb it's kinda getting on my nerves trying to get a new pb

But I can do better on PC later, but put this one to see if it works



there we go



Noice



It's cool af



Looks good



Could be zoomed in more tho



and centered better, little too much on the bottom



The older one also had too much on the bottom, so I thought It'd be better to leave it like the older one

Does anyone know what time the tournament will be in UK time?



There is no specific time, races will be spread out over like a month or so



So when the tourney starts, just find a time you and your opponent are both free



Then let me know, and we'll all hop in VC together and I'll record and commentate the race

Merry Nearly Not Actually Winter Solstice Day Yet Day

I can't say someones pc is bad when I have the shittiest one in the world



I’m doing mine on a school rented chromebook (:



I mean, my mouse and headset are good, just the table thats a little *unexpected*



yo guys, what's that strat that's used to capture momentum at the end of levels 40 and 50 is called? is it limpkick?



Thats an HSG



same principal as 24



except sideways



oh that's HSG then



well what's limpkick then?



Limpkick is just a wallkick, but you do it while falling, so you don't get very much horizontal momentum



oohh



cool



thanks towny <3

I died on level 50 hsg at 3:33 pace again



I did the same thing today



life really isn't fair is it



I guess not



@Towny you gonna do blindfold runs



I tried learning, but I realized that I would have to listen to the OST so I gave up



We should do Helen Keller% where we have to mute the audio too



no



Too soon lol



she died 52 years ago



i got a mod note saying i cant use save state anymore wtf does that mean?



Your video looks like it used a savestate, but I think it was just an abrupt cut in video



yeah the beginning looks like you loaded a save after the intro



ask merpell though, he's the verifier



He should have looked at the mouse though, it's pretty clearly not a savestate



@merpell check urself



It actually got me excited when I saw ices message, cause we've been trying to get savestates for a while :YEPsad:



would be good for submitting splits past 1-10 before gur4 comes out



should we have a version of gur4 that doesnt have tas functionality and is distinctly different from the gur4 that does



would help with
a. having a modern version of gurtrainer to submit il & split runs on 
b. being able to practice on it without clogging your tas folders



I think displaying a watermark on the screen when tas is enabled would be the best option, or maybe a line on the end screen to tell about tas state, idk what's possible and what's not I'm just trying to give ideas



"a line on the end screen to tell about tas state" exists if youre doing a full tas run



but not if you load tas on one level



I didn't know that, btw what's a better word than "a line" coz sometimes I'm just bad at english



i got what you meant so its fine



yup, both a watermark and a score screen message, but during IL tas its buggy

Switch Pro controller



I'm noob



But it's probably the most comfortable controller ever



It's a great controller



I use the logitech F310. It's not really a great controller, but it's D-Pad is pretty legendary

doesnt count its hard mode



doggo with the 0iq strats



F for me after December 31st



why



Adobe flash



oh just download the standalone player and the swf



Gonna be deleted



Don’t you need a pic to do that?



Pc*



I don't think it will, and even if it does we all have copies



There will be plenty of ways to still play give up robot next year



and yeah you need a computer, how else would you play it? lol



I use a laptop to play for and just wondered if you need a pc to download gur



unless you got  chromebook it should work

{Reactions}
crie 


a laptop is a pc lol



nah i use laptop



Yeah about that



Also, I want to bring to everyone's attention that Newgrounds introduced a really user-friendly way to play flash games after the 31st



The newgrounds player can be downloaded and used to play any games off their website



including GUR



It's a flash emulator basically



I use a chrome book sooo



There's a way to play it, why wouldn't a chromebook work?



Look at sensuals comment



yeah but why



Well i have no clue, just thought that a chromebook couldnt download a flash player



I’ll just look it up



look into playing it on newgrounds too

I thinks it’s built in Chromebook but idk



Yeah the standalone player could still probably play it though



or the newgrounds emulator



I don't know why it wouldn't work



Guess I’ll find out haha



It's not like the standalone program will just suddenly stop working. If it works now, it'll work next year



unless sensual knows something I don't know



nope I do not, didn't even know about the newgrounds stuff



Hey towny, do you own the server?



no rtd does I think



but I'm an admin



Ah ok



chromebooks can't play .exe files so that's probably why it wouldn't work



i think anyway



im no chromebook normie



Are there many cool tricks in a give up robot speedrun



It might be cool to make a video like the ones Bismuth does on Mario games about the speedrun



there are



none that are super complicated to explain though



I've been thinking about making videos explaining some of the tricks



I'll probably do them in january when I have time



Has anyone made a world record progression vid



TAS progression would probably be more interesting



No doubt but i just find the idea of a WR progression vid on Give Up Robot very amusing



Or maybe a WR Progression of Google Snake game



Is there a way on speedrun.com to see the list of all previous world records in a category?



yeah, i think so

Wow
Is he dead?



uh yeah he killed himself apparently



fucking sucks, apparently there was some drama that made people dislike him (i hadnt heard of it until today) but i know nobody wanted it to come to this



his video and letter contradict each other on the reason, so i do not think it is worth dwelling on the reason. how much of it was actually the drama is never going to be known



Ezscape and DarkViperAU did nothing wrong on it, DarkViper's video explains it well, but yeah, anyways, Rip apollo



Is it actually confirmed he an hero'd? Cause all I've seen is the video. Maybe he didn't actually go through with it



not 100% confirmed but multiple people have independently said police found him dead in his home



Guys, Arcanod just commented on the TAS video



I'll invite him to the discord



oh god oh fuck



I can't wait for the world record to lower by 15 seconds in a day

thank you towny <3



whoa who's the third?

arcanod



I only saw maislin and HN



if he ever joins



oh makes sense



He's the missing link



Like when Link got frozen in time, the triforce couldn't be completed



true



osama gets absolute legend for daring to run gur2



:omegalul:



Wait he's doing gur 2?



I've downloaded the swf but haven't beat it



too painful



I beat it yrs ago



Lol



the grapple is cool though



Tbh I think it's a better game overall



The first one looks kinda depressing but the sequel has some life in it



gur2 is ruined by the ufo levels



gur2 hard is really fun



though



Wdym



UFO levels?



the bosd ones



U mean. The bosses?



yea



I find them kinda easy



they're not hard but they suck



Tbh I find gur 2 easyer



It's got better physics



true



it had more consistent physics



especially with the grapple



much nicer



Ye



the purple beams are the worst



It's just timing



yeah but why



Lol



why not blocks or something



i like them



I find fast 50 harder then all of gur 2



it is



honestly



I suck at it



the bosses can suck



there are some sorta hard levels in gur2 hard



I've beaten the game probably more than the original



I should try speedruning it



I would but bosses gay



It takes practice but nowhere near as hard as fast 50



Or level one fast



My worst enemy



why speedrun gur2 when you could just not



I keep trying to do wallkicks



Right.



I'm gonna do a speedrun by tmrw



I'm gonna try it



Does anyone have any tips for lvl 1



Fast



don't try to go fast



just try and do the level with the strat



What strat



whatever strat you are using for 1



Ok



like don't try to optimize the movements



the most you'll save doing that is .5



but the amount of runs you'll reset won't be worth it



I just grapple onto the first two blocks, swing and jump on the pole and run to the end



OK that sounds wrong



By the pole i mean the surface



want to call to stream?



It's late in my country



ah



Nearly 1 am



I better sleep

trap adventure?



like a t girl?



theres a game called trap adventure



bot sexuality revealed 😮



i think he is referring to



ahhhh



i think my favorite part is that this comment implies that he thinks the game is called 'former give up robot'



I had something totally different in my head



for me?



for me give up robot is like a trap adventure



no?



maybe



that would make more sense



yesbe



Trap adventure sounds like a 2006 newgrounds porn flash game



it does



how does give up robot remind this guy of trap adventure lol



maybe he's only seen 2 flash games ever



i think thats it



woah, in this game you can jump and die



just like (other game)



:POGGERS:



just like real life



You know, for such a ubiquitous mechanic in gaming, jumping really isn't something you do too often in real life



like honestly



ive thought about that before



whens the last time you jumped?



exactly



i haven o idea



Last time I unironically jumped was probably playing football, which itself is a game



Lasy time I jumped I was competing with my cousin who could jump the higher to touch a plank on the ceiling



ultimate frisbee



I'm gonna speedrun gur 2 today

no



I just suck

offline



flash player and swf file are both available on the src resources page



Download bluemaximas flashpoint is the best bet



or possibly a web flash alternative like sensual suggested



this it?

how godly was your 21-40 wtf



not very godly by the looks of it



just decent



i mean

11-20 was pretty good (55.23), 36.74 is insane (1:31.97), 51.26 is great (2:23.23), 1:12.12 is great for me (3:35.35)

congrats on the wr again rtd! the good run will come soon



i went slow on 44 thanks lycro for the advice 🙂



well, it seems lke it paid off kek



I'm starting to find some more consistent ways of going very fast on 44



yea i'm waiting for you to pb by 10s and quadruple bop



I'm going to be playing again soon, took a break cuz I was only playing for like 3 weeks



cant promise the quadruple bop tho :KEKW:



i lost all my splits



AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



how?



i blew up his computer



i went to try to set a timer for another game, and saved the gur layout



but



i didnt save the splits



cuz i thought saving the layout saved the splits all together



then i erased the splits



but now



im opening and it does not show them



nt



the autosplitter compares to game time or real time



game time right|?



game time

O hey firewarp



Guys been speedrunning, just got sub 5 recently



👋



oh nice



Hello firewarp



Yo what do you guys think of twitch removing PogChamp as an emote cuz of the political bs



imo it's very unnecessary



I think it's ridiculous. I guarantee more than 90% of twitch users had no idea who gootecks was before yesterday lol



But at the end of the day, I at least understand why Twitch did it, as stupid as it is



But FrankerFaceZ removing any Pog emote, I don't get it. I guess they're trying to give the appearance that they're in touch with the community, but literally no one asked for this



"we hear you" lmao



Most people didn't even know who gootecks was and that he is involved with FGC



It amazes me to see that



i def get why they did it cuz gootecks is a huge dumbass but it was probably unnecessary



Very unnecessary and *stoopid*



Stoopid never gets old



it's good that this came at the point where pog was becoming more stale though



wont care as much



Yeah whenever some big thing like this happens, everyone jumps to make it clear they're on the "right side of history". Like Coca Cola releasing a statement. Bitch you make soda, and also fund paramilitary groups to murder trade unionists



:allegedly:



But, it's how it is man. Luckily BTTV is based as fuck and will keep all the pog emotes



yea i imagine its twitch PR mostly



twitch hasnt funded deathsquads in latin america yet tho so its alright

yeah twitch loves to feign good pr. Like the twitch council, and countless vague unenforceable harassment policies



Holy shit trololo is back



if one of the most popular emotes is a picture of a really bad person  i would understand removing it



Eh, I never thought gootecks was a bad person, I just thought he had some subjectively bad opinions. But the funny thing is, what he said this week wasn't even the worst thing he's ever said. Inciting violence is such a reach



Maybe twitch has wanted to cut ties for a while, and it just seemed like this is the right time



But yeah, I understand removing it from their perspective. They care about their image and probably don't think associating with him is good optics



i always thought of the pogchamp emote as karma against gootecks, he hates being known as the pogchamp guy and twitch's popularity and the near universal use of the emote ensured that "the pogchamp guy" was exactly who he was to most people



but removing it is understandable, he's a total nutjob and it could definitely hurt their pr eventually especially after the tweet they removed it for



> Inciting violence is such a reach
with how lightly he seems to have taken the rest of the situation i highly doubt that by "civil unrest" he means peaceful protesting



and with that being his only statement on it he's still basically supporting the riot



bttv removing pog emotes wouldve been dumb, anyone who knows what bttv is knows that pog emotes are only there because they're twitch culture



and people that know that are the only people their pr team needs to appeal to



my main concern with the decision is the chance that the detatchment of pogchamp from the masses will make it suffer the same fate as pepe



except it would be worse because then gootecks would probably start gaining traction in the alt right



Ya I'm sure he 100% supported it. He's a pretty big trumptard iirc. I'm pretty sure that tweet was just him feeling like the BLM riots weren't getting the same amount of scrutiny



Dude if white supremacists start wearing pogchamp pins and flags I will lose my shit



imagine being told six years ago that a white supremacist would go to the capitol holding a captain america shield with the pepe ree on it



Were there any pepes at the capitol? Damn I musta missed it



that was the only one i heard of



lol



I saw one kekistan flag, but other than that this riot was pretty meme-free



I mean, besides that whole crowd in and of itself being a meme



ofc



I remember waking up and the first thing I saw was the forsworn looking mfer standing at the podium



Rolled back over, went to sleep



lmfao



the guy literally just stealing a podium with a massive grin on his face is still pretty funny



idk wtf u guys are on about



USA bullshit lmao



oh im a uk dude



what the riots?



Yeah at the capitol



oh yeah



magahats broke into the capitol a few days ago to stop the certification of biden as president



Then they just left



And achieved nothing



bruh



whats the point of that



i saw a video of them chasing a policeman



Nothing :omegalul:



they almost stole the senators' ballots tbf



i saw in him he shit himself



I think only 5 people died



i heard 4



2 peeps shot



two being magahats, one being a guard, not sure about the fourth



i dont wanna offend anyone but i dont think that was a good move from trump



Not 1 dead politician smh. At least we got some cool pictures out of it though!



I mean, he's finished anyway lol



is this how his legecys gonna end



i mean, i dident know an orange could that much damage



His stans will long carry his legacy



i can beleve that



im so hyped for the tournemnt



yeah ive seen multiple people refer to him with capital pronouns



they arent gonna shut up after biden is in



The tourneys gonna be so fun



im gonna get my ass kicked



cant wait to fail shit cus im used to gur2 physics and go 0-2



also im gonna stick out like a sore thumb withmy high pitched voice



im 13 and my voice hasent even cracked



Well we'll see who you're seeded against



There have been some big upsets before



plz putme up against someone easy



like what



uhhh maistlin losing round 1



but he was like 7 years rusty lol



me acting like i know who he is



lycro beating me was an upset at the time



it wouldnt be now

{Reactions}
😳 


i started gur like 6 yrs ago and im one of the worst players on this discord



a sub 5 really isn't bad



wdym



Your PB is pretty good



thanks



i gotta get better tho



all i want in the tournement is to not fail misrebly



We'll see how you're seeded



i also play really badly under pressure



It's going by PB, so you probably will be paired with someone with a better PB



well, shit



I have wanted to do a random seed tourney some time though



or maybe a handicap one



ok



where we give people head starts based on their pb



but idk if we'll do that this time



plz plz plz



do it



i want to last atleat 3 seconds



We'll see. I'll at least bring it up with rtd



ayy firewarp joined the tourney. We just need 2 more people



Guys, I just noticed we have three people all tied for 29th place with the same exact time of 4:48.97. That's crazy!

allegedly 


what the fuck



Two of them will be in the tourney



nuts



We gotta figure out whos getting seeded above who



We might have to do a pre-race to decide that



aren't we doing random seeding



Are we? I mean, I'm down



I mean, you were in front the whole race but then you turned off your brain at 50



The last tourney went very well with seeded tournament



So I don't see a reason to do it random this time



Well I think seeding by PB would make the round 1 races all pretty one-sided



I think it worked better last time cause we had a losers bracket



I just want every race to be interesting



but we can put it up for a vote



Let's do it then



What option would you guys prefer for the upcoming tournament:
❓ for random selection
🌱 for seeded selection

{Reactions}
❓ 🌱 KEKW (3) 


Put me against someone I won’t get completely pummeled by please (^3^)



r1 monkeyboy432 v cyclowns



:’)



You should probably vote for random then. I think normal seeding would put you against someone with a high PB



am I correct?



I don't really know how seeding works



well if we do seeded



there would be competitive matches atleast in the middle of the pack



like 8 v 9 and 7 v 10 etc.



I'll have to think before voting



one issue i have with random seeding is it could ruin hype



like for example u could get paired with merpell first round



which would be sick but that would be way better in semis



the god merpell



I agree 100% with rtd on this one, but I see the arguments of random seed, so think well before voting guys



And I may sound like a politician here but, don't forget to vote! KEEKEKEKEKEEK



Are there different methods of seeding? Maybe one where first round races aren't so starkly one sided?



It's hard to find non one sided seeding methods



there's the middle method



well idk exactly what it's called



Pausechamp?



Fill me in on that



but it goes 1v9 2v10 3v11 etc



as opposed to...?



i have no clue how normal seeding works



1v16 2v15 3v14 etc.



all the way to 8v9



hm, that one seems like it would have even fewer close ones



but it would be more balanced



which one



the first one



hmm how would splitting the bracket in half and applying that method work out? 1v5, 2v6, 3v7, 4v8 then 9v13 10v14 11v15 12v16



I'm just spitballing



oyea that method exists too



I think that one sounds the most attractive to me



could make an anti-climactic finals



oh true though



what if we weave them together



yea hmmmm



like have those be the round 1 matchups, but place them differently



ya i see



it'd still have problems



like where does the 12v16 go



with the 4v8?



hmmmm



what about



1v5
 9v13
 2v6
 10v14
 
 3v7
 11v15
 4v8
 12v16

I was typing that same bracket out lol



but like this



1v5
9v13
3v7
11v15

2v6
10v14
4v8
12v16



Yours and mine ^ are practically identical



What do you think about doggo's bracket @rtdrtd67 ?



looks good to me



Alright cool, fuck the poll we're seeding it this way



Dem:omegalul:cracy



ill work out the bracket once we get the 16th person in



#fuckthepoll



I do not like this bracket cuz I'm probably going to race against cyclowns or towny ;-;



But I'm fucked anyway so let's go



This bracket is very good, just the quarterfinals are going to be kinda meh but better than nothing



I might be going against rtd round 1 :pepehands:



Rip



unless sensual joins (which he probably wont) or you pb



then ill be against rtd :monkagiga:



Unless we seed my :allegedly: pb



what pb



😉



Seed based on hard mode pbs



ill take it



Since I was added manually will I still have stats?



wdym



I went from 68th to 55th \:00



What's ur pb?



5:33.600



Noice



Do u do fast 50 yet



Nuh-uh.



i just realized i'm tied for 29 lol



We saw lol. That’s incredible!



holy shit theres a 3 way tie for 29th i never even realized



well i submitted my 26 run but thats super cool



holding off on submitting my 3:10 to get seeded lower



understandable



how are you post to do 24 fast



grab 1st block, grab 2nd block, wait a little bit, then max grapple swing so that you get stuck under the 1st block



keep holding grapple, hold up, then once you slip off of the block release grapple



ty



I'm in the tie



Here @csercser3



The macro do be hot

Wish SRC saved what position your run was at the time



Would be cool af



you can look at the leaderboard as of a certain date



so you can go back in time when it was your pb



If you remember the date you pb'd you can check

yeah cos ur way better than me



YOOOOOOOOO grats on the pb ice!



thanks



sub 4 secs on the way? 😳



what is sub 4



sub 4 minutes



im confused



like below 4 minutes



ooh



understandable



i said 4 secs cuz of the name of the video



oh haha



but sub means below certain milestone



like sub 3:30 and etc



oh gocha



idk why i said 4 seconds lol



secretly i beat the game in four seconds and slow it down so others have a chance of getting number 1



im just too good at this game



Thats the osama approach lol



"I don't wanna ruin the competition"



ha



i think im getting better tho



ten secs better then my last pb



i almost just bet your pb but died on 50 twice 😢



so sad



but i least u know what to improve for next time



@icecube5011 you might wanna fix your obs scene, your flash player is a little low down so the bottom gets cut off a bit



i noticed that before how do i make it show the full screen?



just drag it up a bit



oh



thats alot more simple than i thought it would be

I finally recorded a run that's 3rd place



3:35.88



:POGGERS:



allegedly



I would've gotten a PB, but on 50 I accidentally grappled the block and messed up the 2 swing first-pillars



wait what



I didn't beat my unrecorded PB because I had a slow 50



ahh i see



I switched my splits to match my recorded PB, and I'm always red 1-10 because I got a 26.88



LETSGOOOOOOO



Grats on the pb CSER!



Imma watch it ASAP



welp it was nice knowing ya



didnt wanna get out of round 1 anyways



still waiting for dmvt seeding



what does the DMV have to do with seeding



has to do with me driving to the finals babyyy



Thanks Lycro



Joined the server.



hola



surprised this game is still alive tbh



same



wait y'all dont use .exes for the game?



we use the offline flash debugger



huh



which just loads swfs



i mean i like to convert all my swfs to exes for easy launching and stuff but you guys do you



we have a modified version of the game for practicing that is exe



the game is annoying to restart so the flash debugger makes it a lil easier by just being able to laod the swf again



cool



wait this game is alive? :POGGERS:



i mean



i consider it alive lmao



its definitely more alive than most flash games



idk its just a fun and short platformer



ye



good speedgame



nah it is im just memeing



i come from the sm63 speedrunning community



cuz this game was epic



sm63 lmfao



i remember sm63



that game is such a shitshow



that game ran like assss but it was really fun



although it's incredible for flash



we have ways to optimize it yeah



should check out the TAS of the game

to slow the game down



we have a modified SWF that takes inputs from text files



no slowdown or anything



so its a lil annoying to tas at points



but it works



basically wizardry ngl



its a very simple solution



all we really needed



i mean this game is very simple so i can see that lol



oh sup

aka first time playing from 5-6 years lol



ok 2nd time



19:29



a bit better ig



will actually watch a run later lol



would recommend watching arcanod's run for a start



hardest thing he does in it is probably like 48 skip



i dont even remember if he does the hard version of it



he doesnt



so theres like nothing hard other than fast 1



Welcome dignity, gl on the runs



ty



i can get most tricks semi consistently



just lvl 50 is kinda hard'



and lvl 41 is sucky



do u think ur gonna go in the tournement once u got some practice



¯\_(ツ)_/¯



i have absolutely no idea



do u play geometry dash



ur pfp



ye



smae



same



im tring to beat nine circles atm



nice gl



trying to beat acu here



woah



the extreme demon?



mhm



cool



are u 60hz?



ye



same



just wondering did u start in 1.9



na



2.1



wow ur fast at progressing



i started in 1.9 and only recently started getting somewhat good



maybe take this to #other-games ?



ye



slowdown is possible



you can like



use cheat engine



to slow down the game



and do the inputs precisely



like speedhacks?



ye



it is possible but its less precise than what sensual made so doesnt matter



huh



what did he make



^



Slowing down the game rta is really inconsistent and takes like 10x as long to do if you don't have savestates. But it can be done and  be done great. Like the increasingly popular "choppy orc" is rta slowed down TAS I believe



if i can ask, hows the swf modified



do you use ffdec orr????



Yup, ffdec is the easiest to start with. It's kinda weird sometimes so what I personally did was to copy the ffdec code into flash developer, and replace all variable names and make it like nicer.
Though it's not necessarily, depends on how much you want to change.
Small changes can be done directly in ffdec. But bigger ones is much easier to "reprogram" the game with the help of ffdecs code



i c



i use ffdec too to recode some stuff



thanks for your input



I think I'm stupid



I'm considering going for fast 1 every run



well the standard 1 strat already makes it reset hell



may as well embrace it



Also, if you accidentally grapple the second block, it's as fast as normal 1



you're talking to a guy who dies on 13 csercser don't fall for it



youre taking advice from a guy who resets on hard 10



LOL TRUE



Hello @Dignity



Hope you have fun doing runs



Yeah, arcanod is a good way to start since he doesn't do any hard tricks, just clean gameplay



@csercser3  I can't do normal 1 now, once you go fast you can never go back



lol good to know



F



My buddy, #general is where you're going to find the most of off-topic in this server, it's almost an tradition, no need to change



this submarine?



Sub sandwich?



damb i could really go for a sub sandwich rn tbh



they dont have those in egypt tho so sad



I’m so sorry



Any tips for lvl 29? I have a strat, but it’s very inconsistent.



three grapples to the right then wallkick



ez w



I recommend doing wallkicks instead of any kind of fast grapple



the grapple is easier but more jank



Hm. I can’t wallkick yet, but that’s another reason to really learn it lol.



me and cyclowns use a turnaround grapple strat thats very consistent if you get the lineup right



"wallkick bad" -merpell



oh



worth checking that out



their strat also looks cooler



its true



Okay! I’ll check it out rq



and then theres ppl like towny who basically just yolo the turnaround



I mean. Yolo



Oh! That reminds me.



That’s... crazy. Insane. I’m gonna try it



did a run

Nice!



has been submitted



really trash



i can probably lower it to a low 5



before actually watching a run and learning strats



aight verified



give me speedrunner role



🔫



you have to earn it yourself



and by that i mean



you can give it to yourself in #welcome



oh really



i thought it was something you get when submitting a run



im so 4head



well i finished my first day of gur running with a bad 7:40 :POGGERS:



sick



btw y'all



you can still play flash on websites after 1/12/2021

Ruffle
Flash Player emulator written in the Rust programming language



flash emulator



ruffle doesnt work for AS2/3



yet



so GUR is out of the picture



oh really



well it will be soon ig



yea it will be eventually



ruffle is great



also 45 is worst level :)



all the autoscrollers are bad



i mean



yeah but 45 is the worst one



yeah



i keep choking 6:xx and 5:xx to 50 bruhh'



You skip 50 or you do it normal?



normal



I say you try hard 11 because it's much tougher that way 50 will proly become easier for you



dont listen to this crazy man and his delusions

{Reactions}
pausechamp 


just failed a 4:x



nice



to 50



4:30 into 50



nice



and i reached the end first attempt but



i missed the final swing



then i couldnt finish the run



i hate 50 so much



50 is interesting



diff spike at the end of the run



missed another 5:x



to 50



:)



i finally pb-ed

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/798448728876384276/unknown.png



as you can see



50 screwed me over once again



run was 6:00 into 50 anyways



so pretty trash nonetheless



i dont really care about this run since i've been on 4:x paces before



why did this pb man



i really didnt want this to pb



how do you get the speedrun timer?



?



options -> game timer on?



or a different timer



livesplit



if thats what he means



we have an autosplitter btw



how do you get it??



and how do you make it work with gur



https://livesplit.org/

https://livesplit.org/
LiveSplit
LiveSplit is a sleek, highly-customizable timer for speedrunners.
https://livesplit.org/images/twitter.png



just go into edit splits and when you choose give up, robot as your game the autosplitter should show up



just use the splits in resources and have game time set and it should work



as long as you use the game thats in the resources



okay, thanks



can 50 like



stop existing



youll get good at it eventually



then after youre good at it youll start doing 50 skip and hate 50 even more



i cant wait



fr though with enough practice into 50 skip you can get a run thats like ten seconds behind pb pace into 50 and then do 50 skip



and youll pb if its first try



thats how i got my 4:06



YEAAAA



i got a decent time

fast thing :))



i can finally 1 attempt 48 every time



i did some shit in 50 idk how i did but i did



i went insane mode or some crap



nice jump from 7:40 to 5:39



gg



ok apparently i still havent finished my first day of running this game yet lol

best brit on the board



Congrats dig and ice!



Both nice pbs



also gg dignity



I was the best of my country since my first run B)



Sadge



Wish there were more brazillians playing GUR



wait what?
ice got a 4:12?
That's really good and super fast improvment
congrats



Yo @icecube5011 sub4 when



Yeah, he's improving very fast



i can sub 5



the 5 wasnt that good



might even stream tbh



can someone coach me on how 50 hsg



because that would save me



SO many deaths



i need to know how to hsg in general lol



Hsg is all about timing, but like



For me at least, the higher I grapple at the first column of blocks on 50hsg, the easier it is



The lower part too, I just find it difficult if I grappled on the middle



But I think that this is personal



I'd suggest training HSG on 24, if you want to you can download gurtrainer 3 and level select which levels you want to train however much you want. NOT accepted for runs though.

But basically what you do when you hsg is that you get stuck and then you relese Z just when you get free. So for 24 you get ledged under the first block, like in the runs, and shorten the grapple so when you get loose you'll snap into place. if you release during that snap you'll fly



ill test



and yeah i use gurtrainer



how do i get stuck



thanks



Yo, I watched Ice's run and bro, your run looks like arcanod's run, few mistakes and doing the intended strats very well, I think it's time to start putting the strats into your run



You'll get the sub-4 in no time



thanks



huh



i kinda got it



i just went up a little bit



You need to wait a little to get stuck, like go to the right wall (0n 24) wait a little and go under the block



A little I mean like .4 secs or less, idk exactly the time



It'll become muscle memory very fast believe me



it's easier on 24 if you wait a bit before you snap back, you'll go a little quicker up and have mentaly time to prepare



i get stuck on the right wall



i find the hsg in 50 to be easier tbh



Me too



24 takes some time to get used to the setup



defo harder for me



im gonna slow the game down for practice



to just



get the timing



once i get comfortable with the timing



i might stream a bit



got it on full speed



I think doing 24 HSG  is easier than doing 50, but doing 24 fast is harder than 50 faster



Agreed



Yo ice are you going to start doing wks?



I haVeNt ReALLy fiGured tHem out



Believe me, they're way easier than they look



i had my keyboard on the caps key on my laptop haha



i end up normally just shooting myself into the void



That's cuz you're doing them too late



If you're referring to 23 and 32



oh



i should spend more time figuring em out



but gtg



Cuz you need to bounce on the little floor



oh ok



bye



Hope you get them!



ok i think i found a consistent method to get the hsg



pcs just arrived, dont think ill be playing gur as much cos thers no pint buying a pc to play a flash game



i just remembered



tournement



i gotta keep the grind on



til sub 4 maybe

only thing is that icecube moves above flancmou

I'm still going against cser :PepeHands:



ok im going again flanc



at least you arent against rtd



Sadge



You were the only one who could beat him last tourney



You're the chosen one



The only reason I wanted to PB was to avoid rtd round 1



I know how you feel merpell :PepeHands:



Cser, it's all on you



yeah if i were against rtd



The responsibility to defeat rtd



that be unbalanced af lmao



That's why I wanted to go with this seeding



Cause if it were typical seeding you would be against rtd lol



anyways im gonna go stream some geometry dash and ill try getting sub 5 after that



I only have to go against rtd if we both make it to the finals



Pinned a message.



Fixed cuz lazy to scroll up



ill change the bracket on challonge so it actually reflects the bracket



Thanks



can you do that without changing the seed numbers?



I tried moving the bracket around manually, but it would change the contestants seed number



im thinking of hiding the seed numbers then manually adding the people's seeds to their names



Okay, that works!



Good idea



wait i have this fucked



one sec

I'm also glad I was seeded as far away from rtd as possible



everyone with an even seen is seeded equally as far away



Lucky boy

But I'm playing against cser:PepeHands:



The announcement is up fellas



ok



I am up against cyclowns first round cool



major upset time



I got my money on daveed



ez



cyclowns rusty af, get on the grind bro



do we wanna do bracket predictions? its an option on challonge and you can earn points for correct predictions



just as a fun thing



ya i just added seems fun



so long as it doesn't affect the integrity in any way im fine with that



well its just for bragging rights



lollll



No one intentionally throw!



money on the line for predictions



no reason for people to throw for the bracket predictions



wtf how do i even start a prediction



ah i see nvm

if I get 50 follows we can do channel point betting on the races



thanks dignity!



you hvae >3 average?



thats insane



hardest thing to get



oh yeah, I have all the other requirments



when you speedrun active games its not too difficult



I was already followed



yeah most viewers are from this community



like i only have 15ish and i can still average 2-3 because of gur



probably shouldnt speedrun sm63 on twitch then lol



:peepoSad:



lol sm63



even though its the most active mario flash game



i still get like

why cant we make more than one prediction

:Glizzys: glizzy gaggle



Although I would get upset if someone reverse sweeped me



whats a reverse sweep



leading 2-0 in a bo5 -> losing 3-2



Yeah cyclowns won the first two races, then I won three in a row and won



not necessarily just in a bo5 but it applies to all boX



im gonna win every match

my accent makes me sound a bit older tho



nevada doesnt have alot of grass



mow sand then



egypt has none lol



yeah mow sand



:pogu:



who do you guys think is gonna win the tourney?

in my dreams lycro



Lycro



realistically rtd



mmm



m e



rtd



Give me some laptops that can download flash, dm



amazing



yo just got flash to work

:Hmm:



Surely there must exist some kind of way to emulate flash on a chromebook



probably



what happened to "fuck rtd but i'm here for the points"

Honestly losing to lycro would be an honor



i wish to make it to the finals



for the chance to lose to lycro



the ultimate honor



honestly i rly believe in the lycro win



i havent finished a run in  months i think



If lycro beats cser round 1, it's very possible he makes it to the finals



but that will be his most difficult race



how about flancmou in semis



W H :omegalul:



tbh if klice upsets towny



>implying flancmou will beat towny



i could see that



flancmou is gonna roll towny



but given klice's z key history idk



nah actually dignity



klice key falls off round 1. flancmous surrenders in round 2 in classic french fashion. lycro fucking annihilates me in the semis. This is my prediction



I am known (in my one tournament) to be absolute trash round 1



hence why lycro is beating you in every prediction



?



might stream gur rn



in the mood



I have become a Lycro Supremacist

goat status



including wr holders in both categories as well



goat



and gur2 probably



nah gur2 has quite a few



thought it had like six



or does that count as quite a few



ye



it has 10 actually

Literally the actual worst place to literally die in this game



what about to limp 50 hsg twice :YEPsad:



last pixel of 50?



worst as in most timeloss



thus the "literally"



i literally dont like you



wait what



toxic



😉



thats tru though



probably most timeloss



last pixel 50 is definitely the most embarrassing place to die



did the gray separators on SRC get darker or is it just me



yeah they changed the font a bunch



for unknown reasons



the website is as little different



a fucking  deathless run and then 9 deaths on 50



meh deathless runs are overrated



its the worst feeling one but most embarassing is 10 probably



i probably got  a bit tilted after the first death but  still



was the first death to hsg



yeah



yeah understandable



hey you still got 6 disco balls :omegalul:



Totaly unrelated but SRC newest newslatter mentions that you get request getting on the front page for like TAS premieres or Tournaments and shit...

ay prime time to start polishing the hardmode tas then



Holy shit I would love to get TownyTV on the front page



towny television on the front page of NYT



yeah, should sign up the tourny maybe, the TASes should sign up to prolly



towny television on the front page of playboy



One time I found a collection of decades of playboys all categorized chronologically at barnes and noble



I stole it



It was all centerfolds iirc



towny beast



know how you feel, my pb was going to be deathles but 2 deaths on 35 ,_,

truthers



also 101% wtf



Yo I think I might get A new pb



in vc



BRO LEVEL 50 GETS ME EVERY fING TIME



I was gonna get like 4:40



Joined the server.



hello



Hello, Bob!



Hey! I'm looking to find a site to start speed running this game. I played it all the time back in 8th grade and really wanted to try to speedrun it



It'll be hard to do it through browser since flash is dead, but try newgrounds



newgrounds has their own flash emulator you can install and play it on



otherwise, check the resource page on SRC, you can download a standalone flash player and the swf



I think I tried that but I could not get it to work. Mind walking me through it? Youtube just kept skipping the part I was having problems with



idk if the newgrounds thing works for gur



you're prohbably gonna have to get the offline adobe debug thing and  just use that



which isnt difficult



https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/32/flashplayer_32_sa_debug.exe



Every time I try to open it up in new grounds it just doesn't work



https://www.speedrun.com/tools/GiveUpRobotNoAdultSwim_tkgcj.zip



Do I have to unzip this or can I just put this into flash?



unzip



you put the .swf in



Got it to work. Thanks



I just killed an amazing run
26.6 (amazing)
52.8 (gold)
1:29.38 (gold and wr pace, -5.2)
2:23.95 (okay, only -0.77)
3:42.57 (rip the PB)



Thank you for your sacrifice. In your loss I got a new PB by over 10 seconds ^ㅈ^



With some bad luck, good comes from the other end



congratulations



Thank you. I’m sorry for your loss as well... I mess up enough times that you’ll be on rainbow road through most your runs though lol.



imagine trying to play the game as fast as possible LOL you're missing the best parts loser! you've basically lost already! you're cheating for what, to say you beat the game faster than me? good for you my dude you learned to do something that you do over and over and rarely succeed at just so you can say you did it once or twice really well, it's all luck really and you should feel bad for wasting your time



I’m actually using speedrunning this game as a coping mechanism for the heartbreak I received not too long ago. To you, it may seem to be a waste of time, but to me, it’s my one source of personal fulfillment with a lovely, striving community to support me.



It's a copypasta lol



I know lol.



But I can relate to the heartbreak



i speedrun so that i can finally be fast enough to escape my failing marriage

Sadness reduction strats



Does it save time tho?



If you can skip the second child in the initial stages, you can save a bit of time and money which will both be necessary when signing divorce papers later.



Lmao you didn't even learn the get sterile strat yet 😂😂 what a noob it saves like 25.4k



And I recently discovered a divorce skip, you have to early unlock twitch, and then donate 16k to streamers (only work if you donate to girls) and then your wife will just have pity on you and stay with you (and another guy at the same time)



That's why you need the sterile money save to get the divorce skip



Intense routing ik



I agree! I usually go the “Unforgivable Act.” route.



I just kill her dad day one.



That route is too glitch abusive



I prefer the death%



I once got addicted to smoking at 4yo (WR pace) but I got bad rng and got lungs of steel)



It'd be the new death glitchless% by like 1,5years



Cyclowns death glitchless% WR is optimized af



i prefer 100% true ending runs where you actually save the marriage



Nah, the main wife is annoying af



I like the 106% where you get a lover tho



The gay% is in kinda gay imo



Can confirm. Is gay. The neighbor is a lot easier to deal with doe



Yeah, that's why it's gae



gæ



Why are you gæ?



Yay!! Pb submitted \:D



“...I’m not gay”

So, who is gæ?

The Rumor Come Out: Does Bruno Mars is Gay? - Bruno Mars
Bruno Mars is gay is the most discussed in the media in the few years ago. Even it has happened in 2012, but some of the public still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about his gay.
https://brunomars.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bruno-Mars-Cover-GQ-Biceps.jpg



Yeah! 5:22.83



Does  bruno mars is gay, wtf is that grammar?



It only gets better, my friend.



Holy shit now I'm curious to read it



its one of those like horrific autogenerated articles



its really funny



"Even it has happened in 2012, but some of the public still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about his gay.''



There is a rumor comes out about his gay



His gay



I have to agree



I mean. It’s written for the common folk.



This look like it was written by an AI trying to make an article, bit the difference is that this AI is from 1833



It's more confusing than an elaborated text



I really like bruno mars music tho



Ye lol. I’ll listen to him every now and then. I just can’t think about him without this article popping up in my skull.



And now it'll happen to me too



Lol



You’re welcome ^-^



man dont you love doing 24 first try then hitting the last block



that means u didn't do it first try :KEKW:



a



man dont you love doing the 24 hsg first try then hitting the last block



Good news: I'm not dead



yoooo



kekw



ok uh question



who wrote the code for gur autosplitter



ero



im not sure if they're still in this disc



nope



huh



\;(



code is actually spaghetti



reading through it rn



asl code is wonky



i dont really care as long as it works



it doesnt really need maintenance



my code is really spaghetti too anyways so lol



the only line that looks kinda spaghetti is
```
var timeConverted = (Func<double, TimeSpan>) ((value) => { return TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Round(Convert.ToSingle(value) * 100 / 60) / 100); });
```



*100/60/100 seems legit



not sure why ero took a week to make this tbh



with gur's simplicity



should've taken a few days at most



pointerpaths are rly deep cuz its like embedded in the flash player



and its really annoying to find the game timer pointerpath



oh yeah fair



pointer paths suck



beyond that the logic is pretty simple



i was working on it before him and i had all the logic just got lost trying to find pointerpaths



Has anyone other than rtd gotten sub 3:30 yet



sensual



yea sensual got the god run



For that matter, has rtd gotten sub 3:20 yet



then died like 3 times



nope



sensual got the fucking godmode run up to 41-50



like 2:14 going into 41



or something



what was it like  a 2:14



dafuq



or 2:13



yea



thats a speedy run



tas shit



The "dafuq" was at rtd having a 3:24



its really funny cuz the run is like hella sus on its own



its super choppy and shit up to 41 when he's doing godlike then the video quality gets better in 41-50 where he dies 3 times



lmao



I just tried to plug this fucker into my headphones

this has uncanny parallels with gur



wtf 1 hour



- one runner dominating alone at the beginning (arcanod)
- another runner comes to beat the dominated time and never get wr again (merpell)
- two top runners trading wr afterwards (rtd & cyclowns)
- underdog that had shown skill elsewhere gets a run barely under wr followed by wr (sensual)
- one of the other top runners follows by lowering the wr multiple seconds below anyone else, also dominates a tournament (rtd)
- barely possible autoscroller skip near the end of the run that can theoretically crush wr but is basically a joke to seriously attempt



also kinda like smo



also the run is basically just as long, segmented run that crushes the seemingly pipedream 3 minute barrier, one category extension that barely anyone cares about but is still decently optimized



and a tournament with a cash prize happening right now



and a mechanic that youtube commenters think is cheating



fuckin weird



yooo just got a new pb

damn



thats a good 1-40



thats low 4 pace, you gotta tighten up that endgame



^



ye



i keep dying on 50



yeah you could probably save like  a minute over your pb with a faster 41-50



mainly 47 and 50



:towny:



i think im gonna get low 4 without doing too many strats



only strats im implementing are 22 and 24



43 free



i keep failing it ok



just got a new 40 pb



yea im baiting



43 actually free



ill do it after like sub 4:2x



you could go for the better 48 skip

but thats like the third least consistent trick at top level



new 40 pb



only because its inconsistent not because its hard



bro



how



I have no idea



ive started doing the uhhh



finish the run



some strat that isnt that bad



but i forgot the level



1 attempt 50 and 47



describe



ill stream in discord



spinner, extend to max grapple, go right inbetween the lava



38 ?



instead of  flinging yourself against a wall and falling down



might be 38 yeah



similar layout to like  9



yeah 38



my man legit gonna get 4:0x



i think ive almost already memorized all of the levels in gur2



o he chokin



this kid is on fire



he choked the pb to 50



COPYCHOKE702 :lul:



can you sub 4 with a  2:50  1-40?



THE CHOOOOKE



whats going on in the voicechat?



if youre rtd yeah



copycat choked new pb



rtds 41-50 gold is 1:05



so   barely



he says 1:05 isnt good



actually



but thats by rtd standards



There's always next run



i might come and stream in general in a sec



i dunno if it has 45 hsg or not



or twitch



probably twitch stream in a bit



MMM



It was a good effort copy



ye



how hard is  43 hsg



free



43 hsg is so free with the setup



43 hsg is about as hard as 24 once you get the setup down



wait really



what is the  setup then



grapple second block   let go of right and hold up   ungrapple and insta-regrapple after a bit



Hold up right, grapple block, release right when you make contact, release grapple when you're under the block, grapple and do a sick nasty HSG



how much height you get can have a lot of influence on how you do the end of the level though



if you go super high and dont react you can just try to grapple the top right block, miss and die



i gott a practice that 24 skip



but yea its not really harder than 24 or 50 hsg



towny slide is probably unironically the hardest hsg lol



it is



its the least punishing to miss though



i got a towny slide with a  really short grapple yesterday i think



that was nice



ok



gonna stream



twitch



you could argue 45 hsg is harder but the setup for 45 isnt bad



not as short as i rememberd

i think thats half towny slide



that's like 2/3rd towny slide



are there more than two speed variations



idk lol



id assume theres two bc its a two frame trick



well when i tested those two frames, both gave the same speed I think



So I think it's possible, based on certain factors, that it may extend to a 3 frame window, with one of those frames being limp



ive gotten 43 a few times now but im still having trouble with it



I need some sleep its almost 4 am



im suprisingly  more consistent at 46 hsg



46 hsg requires less practice



but if you grind both 46 becomes harder



insane

lol



including a  failed 47



are you holding left during that



cus you dont have to



idt it makes a difference



facts



idk why



oh you can do it without left



thats weird



i mean robot is only moving bc theyre extending grapple



which moves them down and left



just failed my two  best 1-10 runs to 9

jumpyluff is involved in every flash game in the book so that part wasnt too surprising



yeah  thats true



i kept going for  normal 50 becuase i wasnt consistent enough at fast 50



but im not consistent at normal either



so i should just  do fast anyway



fast saves like 10 seconds, it's 100% worth



the 50 hsg helps too



yeah the hsg adds 5 seconds of timesave on



i dont think ive ever  finished a full fast 50



but ive gotten multiple attempts past the  autoscroller section



just keep practicing, yul get it eventually (:



and then i just  miss the hsg/normal strat



it just takes practice



i used to be shit at it



i mean



i know i can do it



i just  havent done it yet



a big part of fast 50 is doing such a difficult thing under pressure



if your about to pb



it doesnt feel like this  really hard trick anymore



i just keep messing up



i dont do fast 50 at all



since this is my 2nd day running this game lol



the last three pillars are probably the ,most annoying parts for me

oo thats annoying



i found it quite frustrating to learn the hsg cos i dont get to the end of the level very often



im still not 100% on the hsg



if u fail the hsg then while you are falling u can grapple the blovk ahead of u and save it



and then just do it normally



yeah i usually try that



but doing it normally is also dumb



i think practice will help most



sometimes during school live lesson if i getbored then i open upp gur trainer and do 50 over and over again



@pansear ❤ if youre grappling the bottom or 2nd-to-bottom block of the ending pillar then regrapple



yeah i knew i was  too low



if youre too low    regrapple



ideally if youre not comfortable with the hsg your grapple should be touching the top block at least somewhat



can someone tech me how to wallkick



hold up next to a wall
grapple for 2 frames



(try to grapple for 1 frame)



so i need to go up to a wall and double tap grapple



No you hold the button "up" and try and press grabble button for 2 frames only



the way wallkicks work is that



you shorten your grapple



to shorter than it should be



so the game tries to extend your grapple again



and during that moment you let go of your grapple  so you just get pushed away from the wall



oh



makes sense now



I'm going to kill myself

2:22! You're insane



NOOOOOOO RIP TOWNY :(



Godlike splits



I cant even describe how I'm feeling right now



I never want to play this game again



i lost 3 low 4:x paces to



50



can we just change the main category to 1-49 pls



i feel like i can sub 4 without too much trouble



maybe in a week



if 50 is nice



which it isnt



towny with the 5head choke strats to make it seem more believable when he throws against klice



klice domination confirmed



Klice gets 2x in race to assert dominance



klice wins the tourney to assert dominance



he already has



might as well just ff



whenever i try to wallkcick i just get shot downmards



Yeah that happens



which level are you trying on?



23



i havent had a single succseful attempt



where do you end up? Hitting the spinner?



ye



go lower



That means you're kicking too high



oooooooooooooooooo



thats what it issss



ive been doing them really high



yeah idk what causes robot to jump, but it seems to send you if you hit the corner



so yeah try a little lower

still too high



still?



ok



yeah that video you're way too high



gonna try even lower



stream continues, towny?



a little later perhaps



kk



try to do the grapple input when the robot is beside the blue tile



or about to be beside the tile above it



still too high????

All of them were too low, except the last one, which was too high



rtd makes wallkicking look so easy



You'll get the hang of it



hopefully



if you are trying to aim for one spot then make sure every jump is a full one



gocha



for consistency



k



had a 1-40 run on like. 4:1x pace



oh yeah, make sure you're always holding up icecube



and then messed up everything



or else the wallkick doesn't work



is my method wrong? to wallkick i tap grapple then jump as fast as possible



yeah that's the way to do it



all you need to do is hold up, then grapple for two frames



yeah you jump first



i usually try to grapple for 1 frame



because that is unlikely to happen and then i get a 2f



and win



aaaaa i cant do ittt



soooo annoyyinggg



is it possible to get a sub 4 without wallkicks



definitely



very



arcanod got a 4:06 with like    no strats



first sub 4 was before wallkicks were a thing



cyclowns' 3:48 wr was before wallkicks actually



well screw them



i hate em



so hard to pull off



every wk people unironically do (6 22 23 29 32 34 36) saves like six seconds total



worst think about walkicks is  doing them on 23 and losing time



same setup as 32 but the intended 23 is faster than 32



and 5

hard 10



i can use em on that level



oh wait the new start was faster than doing a wk



and both save like



.3? lol



worth it



fair



Is it common to have a pb whenever your not recording?



yes



i always play better when im not under pressure



Why do you people play if you aren't recording lmao this happens so often



I just went sub 5 for the first time since 8th grade and I wasn't recording the run



oof



It's common to only have recording errors on PBs for me



Still a lot of mistakes but that's progress



defo



sub 5 is really good



4:53:.67. 49 seconds faster than yesterday



i justify it by telling myself im doing warmup runs



i always record whenever i  start doing serious runs



which is  most of the time



@Towny are u gonna be streaming again today?

by like 3 ms



Yo what do you guys think of the 5 minutes thing that merpell put on #announcements ?



And grats on the pbs copycat



I think the concept is fine but 5 minutes is not the barrier I think it should be at. But I just came here so the regulars might have a differing opinion



Are you saying the barrier should be a lower time or a higher time?



Imo lower time. I'm gonna supply videos of my runs regardless



I think 5 minutes is good because that's when it starts getting harder to improve, hence why proof is necessary. The lowest I would be okay with is like 4:30



I was thinking 4:30. 5 is still ok tho



i would prefer a higher time than 5



when I started running it could be discouraging when it felt like my runs weren't good enough to even require video proof



despite 5 minutes not being the easiest goal to reach



if that makes sense



hmmmm that's an interesting point



wouldn't that also motivate one to reach a point where runs would require video proof though



does anyone know if there's a file for give up robot 2?



its on the gur2 src page



under resources



also in #gur2



oh red ball discord has a list of the 20 hardest strats that have been pulled off rta



thats neat i wonder what ours would be



11 blockless



top 3 is probably elevator skip, 44 2-swing and blockless h11



ELEVATOR SKIP :lul:



did maistlin do elevator skip rta



yea



lmao



oh shit you mean



the gur1 one



nvm



yeah gur2 elevator skip is free



4 hwk, 43 wk, 29 platform skip and fast last pillars are probably up there also



finally got one

Just realised there's 69 slots for the voice channel



Noice



is blockless hard 8 possible?



yeah



I think maistlins done it



ive only beat hard mode once lmao



Joined the server.



Oh welcome, that's a name i recognize



Yeah I ran into him in another streamers chat and recognized the name too lol



welcome



Yeah, I used to run that game a long time ago



I've got no plans of coming back to the game, I just wanted to see what has changed since I quit



an rtdrtd67 run will show you just about every RTA trick in the book lmao



he just got a wr yesterday



oh wow



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiPfuJMB-cU



wait sub-4 has been achieved? 👀



yeah by like 10 people haha



check out the leaderboard https://www.speedrun.com/gur1



should check out the TAS as well, that's sub 2:30



so yeah, how does that "wall kick" mechanic work? do you just pull the hook for 1 frame?



2 frames, while holding up so robot gets pushed backwards



on the 2nd frame



A few of us do it RTA, but it's hard since it's frame perfect



interesting, I'm guessing you'd pretty much just save it for the places where it saves the most time, right?



Yeah like 32



but people like cser and rtd get really bold with them lol



it's kinda crazy to see that it's only small strats that somehow add up to 40 seconds that got found, and I'm guessing that the biggest time save is probably level 50 too



Well there are other things that contribute to the 40 seconds. Like level 22 going between the spinners



since the autoscroller skip was known back when I did runs, but it was done very safely and the 4:06 former WR didn't do it



and now you even do one of these boosts at the end



oh yeah, those are called HSGs, like on level 24. Those save quite a bit too, and it's like a 6 frame window



what even is the framerate of this game?



30?



60



it's not every that you get to see a flash game with 60 FPS lol



my main Flash speedgame is Fireboy and Watergirl nowadays, and it's 25 FPS



I've never played that before I'll have to check it out



my main is sm63



I've heard sm63 was a pretty good fangame



a few of us also run Dr. Mario: Vitamin Toss

allegedly (2) 


sub 2:30 has been tas'd



barely any levels in the tas are replicatable even with a .1s cushion though



11 used to be the exception to that rule



an* exception



and you can still get .1s behind tas by doing it normally



but yeah 11 skip was a meme for ages and now it Is Not



levels that have an il .1s or less slower than tas:
2 (mid)
3 (kinda hard)
4 (ludicrously hard)
6 (kinda easy)
8 (hard)
10 (easy)
11 (easy)
12 (kinda hard)
15 (probably hard?)
17 (easy)

32 (mid)
33 (prob hard)
35 (very hard)
41 (mid)

every other level is more than a tenth of a second faster than anyone has ever done them

-0.2



oh wait that uses a ceiling kick doesnt it



ceiling kick at the end yeah



OH WAIT



the last block in 50 actually goes up



WHAT NO WAY



:POGGERS:



i never realised that before



im so 4Head



1head



YOOOOOO welcome TBC! Cool to see a veteran player here, we've evolved a little since then



yo, at the end of 25 is it faster to ungrapple off the spinner while hold down or to just go until the end of the lvl in the spinner?



For me, letting go is faster



i dont think it makes enough of a difference to consciously think about



which one is 25 again



but like csercser i would think that letting go would be faster



the one after the hsg?



Yeah



i just hold



the real time save comes from stopping before the spinner



trueeee



skipping spinner with a swinghop uwk is faster



uwk?



upward wallkick



facts



thx both of you \:D



most free 0.2 you'll ever get



if youre gonna stop then go the full mile



jump left



says the guy with a 3:57 pb omegalul



says the guy who doesnt skip the spinner in 25 with swinghop uwk



says the guy who can only pb when his game only shows in a quarter of the screen

You're both just awful

no im playing



nvm

i thought lycro was 7th seed



mb



no im 6th and unfortunately going against cser



but I'm training a lot to make up for a good and close race



yeah unfortunately for cser he has to face you



i have a disadvantage in bo5/bo7 because as the match goes on i get worse



i got two 3:3x against towny in a row and then beefed like 5 rounds



mad cause bad :LELW:



play on NEW GAME 10x% category to train consistency smh



my brain sux



how much time would a 10x take?



like 45 min?



if you had an 4:30 average



yea probably like



40-50 min



i think my avg is like 4 min flat

lost a 26.xx to 9 dammit



imagine if I get a 26 before I get a 53 lmao



that would be crazy



:6head:



yo cser,  have you been playing on a desk or still at the bed?



whats about that thing that doggo said about holding left in 48 to go further/faster?



huh



that was cyclowns



Oh, ok then, but how does it work?



Bed lol



I just spent an hour trying to download doom on my Calculator but my computers like



Ahaha. I don’t know what a calculator is :33



But I’ll find a better pc and I’m gonna download so much doom. Maybe even gur if I can find it.



Yo monkey, crispy doom will definitely work on your pc



I can send you all the WAD'S on #other-games



It’s not that my pc can’t run the games, it’s that it refuses to recognize the calculator.



Is it just me or is GUR getting a lot more popular on speedrun. I mean we get newish players submitting runs almost every day.
I mean it's far from the peak of active players, but isn't that just because of a lot of the OG players hasn't submitted in a long time



Maybe I'm tripping but every day I'm going in nowadays the belll has like a 4 or something besides it. Can't remember it was like that before



ik



i dident think a flash game would have such a big community



we've gone from 70 to 90 speedruns over the period of weeks



Yeah, we're getting like 3 runs almost per day



added #deleted-channel



I'm ok with this



Man



I just did a run where after level 40 I think my time was just over 3 minutes, and then hard choked on 43 and ended with a 5:43. That could have been so much better



3:08.30 after 40 levels



Level 43 is a rapscallion >:0



It's better than the time I submitted but not good enough for me to want to



wow! 3 minutes on 1-40 is like 4:1x pace! congrats!



it'd be 4:0x if you did it perfectly, so I think 4:1x is more suitable



Other than a few deaths on level 40 and a meh level 1 I felt like I was doing really well



yeah, you're! just do not stop the grind



and finish runs



I should just practice 43



I used to reset a lot very early into the run, it truly hurt my endgame



practicing is always good



It's the only level that actively screws up my runs



REALLY?? I REALLY gotta learn fast 50.



yeah! but like, only if you do it at top level quickly, that why it's kinda wrong



like



technically you can, but like, rtd has a 1:05 41-50 on his wr



I can get a sub five if I do well currently, but otherwise, it’s low fives.



like, its possible, but not really feasible for most of us (even me included)



whats ur 1-40 time?



I've gotten a sub 5 once but I was not recording



but man, if you have a 3 min 1-40 you can get a 4:2x no problem!



just train your endgame, I took a long time to start training it and regret it



Yeah. It’s usually 3 or so minutes.



Endgame will be trained 👍



then a 4:2x is not far from you monkey



believe me, its where you can shave most of your time



you lose in average 1.5 secs to every death in 41, 47 and the start of 43,46 and 48



you can shave A LOT of time there



I'd just say to reset less



In the end game I think 43 and 47 are the 2 that I really struggle with. Any advice to get it more consistently?



47 is really easy if you get the setup, its goes like this: when the level starts hold up right until you get close to the spinner (not too close or you'll hit the lava) when you grapple the spinner hold down until you release it



idk how to explain when to release it, but if you try this setup in GURtrainer you'll get what I'm saying



do you have GURtrainer already?



No



It's a modified EXE that let's you replay any level



its  on the resources page on SRC



Just open it in the flash player?



There are some versions



The main ones are 2.0 and 3.0



2.0 is a SFW file, so you open it on the flash player



But 3.0 is an EXE



so you download and run it yourself



3.0 has some quality of life changes



But I prefer 2.0 since is the same size as the one in the flash plsyer



Download the one you like better



Which one you downloaded?



3.0



Easier to set up



Not really, 2.0 you just download it and run on the flash player



But ok, both are equally helpful!



You see



I have monkey brain



I didn't think to try that and spent 3 minutes trying to extract a file



The important thing is that now you'll be able to train your most problematic levels



But even with the trainer, try to finish runs



Doing the later levels in a real run with pressure is different than training them



And @LeBob  gur trainer is not allowed for full game runs



You have to use the original SWF



I figured



And I forgot to mention and thanks @SensualPudding  for making this wonderful trainer



But for now I'll focus on just figuring out a consistent strategy for clearing those 2 levels. I think I found one on 43 but I'm gonna try a few other things



no worries buddy, was fun



Tell me if you're getting the hang of the setup I told you :D



And yo @Towny the game I told you yesterday, Bomber crew is free on Humble Bundle, play it live lmao



remind me when i go live tonight



Kk



Working on 43 right now. I think I found a strat that is fairly consistent and is faster than just doing the level normally



if youre not doing hsg the fastest strat is to grab the 3rd block, contract and grab the block above it, extend to land on the 2nd block, then jump and grab the last block



the fastest rta viable strat anyway



I take it I'm supposed to use the first block to reach the third one?



no you can just make it



its precise



using the first block shouldnt lose more than half a second though so its fine



i think the actual fastest glitchless strat is to grab the first block then jump off of it while its falling



but thats ludicrously hard lol



I found that (It's a little tight) I can swing off the first block to grab the one above the third block



Then jump off of 2-4 to get to the end



if it works it works



yo that strat is cool



It's faster than the level normally



grabbing the top block asap should be faster than jumping off all 3 bottom blocks though



I can probably do that



I'll mess around a bit



Grabbing the top block (at least from my attempts) saves about .15 seconds



So I don't really need to do it but I might as well learn. I'll take the time save wherever I can get it



my best time is a 4.28 with the lebob 43



Dang



My best was a 4.90



rtd 2 good



Still it's consistent enough that I feel comfortable using it. I'll do a few practice runs and see if I can get it



my best 43 time is i think 3.15 but thats with hsg



I still think that the 43 IL is sick af



HSG+WK very cool to see it



Even tho it's kinda old at this point



yeah still one of the most impressive things done rta so far



Well I improved over earlier this week, still not sub 5 but 5:09.35 is still pretty good for me

Well now to replicate what I did somehow



You’re on a solid 597243 pace!



woah nice



thats IL record by .07



Yea



Now just to get video evidence of that



man



this entire community just don't know how to press the start recording button on obs



:lul:



So how does the wall kick work?



be against the wall



hold up



and press z for exactly 2 framws



Is there anyway to get that kind of boost at the end of a swing?



Because I think that's what I did



that's an hsg



Ah



no



what



I think you're thinking of swinghop



which also wouldn't give you a boost



isn't hsg getting a boost at the end of a swing



no



well



well in the context of 18



I switched to down and let go of my tether and got a boost



definitely not



I mean



Let me get the video of what I did and I'll show you



and even so



that's a pretty bad definiton for hsg



it's still getting a boost at the end of a swing



since you stop a swing and get a really big boost



so I'm technically right



congrats



take that rtd :pausechamp:



yeah probably a result of wonky grapple physics



i think that mini 18 boost is just



wonky grapple yup



unless you went under and didn't use the moving block?



then you actually swinghopped



no way he got 2.28 going under



it's probably possible w swinghop



ah but ig why would u release so low if u didn't even know



well yeah the tas proves that, but idk if that's the boost he was talking about



the "hsg" if you will



No I grappled the moving block, swung under the first lava blocks then as I was over the second set I held down as I let go



I think



yeah sometimes you get a boost when holding down and releasing. But you must have just done the level very exceptionally



I'll send a clip of the boost I got one sec



Right at the end of my tether I got a boost somehow

its unpredictable

The pee bees man, the pee bees



You've come a long way since under 10 minutes lol



Yeah you did fire



Sub4 when?



i've been practiceing idvidule levels alot not going for pb



No worries man do it when you feel comfortable



Hopefully I can officially get a sub 5 soon



You'll get it very soon trust me



Yeah, you got this



Thanks for the votes of confidence



I'd just tell you to be confident on yourself



I just need to practice the last 11 levels a lot more



When I had a 4:22 I felt like I'd never get a sub4 cuz I trash lol XD git gud, so when I manage a run sub4 pace I'd just be pessimistic about it and kill the run



yeah those are the hardest



Every other level I can usually get consistently



40 is hit or miss



and then there is 41-50



But when I started seeing that I maybe could I started being a little more confident and got my sub4 pretty quickt



I'd say I only started being more confident after the 1st tournament



I've done a sub 5 run

I just didn't record it



So I know I can do it I just rush when I don't need to



I know that, but I'm talking about future times, cuz that's when shit gets hard



Ah



Sub 5 first. Then I can work on sub 4:30



Do not stop the grind!



I BEIEVE IN YOU



I've gotten a sub-5 I recorded it like a good boi 🙂



gogo, please PB by .26 exactly 🙏



we need the 4:20.69 on the leaderboard



Joined the server.



damn right knuckles



also .x9 is impossible unfortunately



oh fuck you're right



hello chicken nugget



Wait why is that?



how the game calculates time, it skips some hundredths



Does it calculate by frame rate?

god damn i hate that last pixel lol



good thing I do HSG



switch to OBS 🙂



^



game runs at 60fps, so the time only ever ends on .000, .016, .033, .050, .066, and .083, so with rounding it cant end on .01, .04, .06 or .09



pain



4:26



new pb



:POGGERS:



nice



Firewarp might be the next sub 4 after all



He's the the closest if you count the activity too, cuz the ones that are closer are not really active recently



So FireWarp has a good chance



Copycat too



I wanna see who'll get it first



Congrats on your pb fire!



ty



does anyone wanna play skriblio?



Yay! New PB! Not as impressive as FireWarps, but it’s my first sub 5 \:D



4:51.47



congrats!



Thankie! Your video about the hsg really helped on 24. I’m still getting 43 and 46 down tho.



gg! The sub 5 barrier feels great to break



really tho. This is more gratifying than clearing out all of my tabs after a long project - and that's saying something.

Nice!



Congrats on the pb monkeyboi!



Thank you! I’m training hard so you have at least a little competition on the 25th :3



yooooo monkey grats on the pb!



Thank you! I took your advice and for about 2 hours, I never reset once.



see @rtdrtd67 , this is what usually happens in my games, I just completely botch the opening, and then I win in the mid-game because my opponent misses a tactic https://lichess.org/WoyhHisM/black

It's just easy to know that your opponent is bad at chess when they want to do the fried liver against you



well fried liver is a legit opening



there's a lot of theory on it



i suck at chess



I know that it's something, it's just that people just use it to add extra difficulty to their opponent

That's like 3:36 pace or something dang



same is true about 13



I've fallen for both of them



rtd outing me :peepoSad:



36 is inconsistent as fuck so not doing it is fair but honestly 13 is free timesave even if its less than .1



i failed faster 13 like 1/5 of the time



and i failed normal 13 like 1/50 of the time



so fuck that



im probably less consistent at normal 13 now from how little i do it



same

Here's where I found GUR



When I was like 7 yo lol



yo i see spunch bob on the bottom right



Sad that FRIV died "long " ago



There were a lot of strange games in there



One of my favorites was power pamplona



I found gur on a site called Vendzor Games like 2 years ago.



So sad for friv doe \:(



Only the great games



I remember there was a platformer game on friv where you could draw your weapons, at the start we draw swords and shit but then we started drawing dicks instead :KEKW:



It was much funnier



What else are you supposed to draw?

Respect+ for dealing with windows 8 that long



thx, I always was lazy to upgrade



never thought it was that easy



thought you needed to pass it to a pendrive and shit



so easy lmao



It was only recently made this eaay



seriously? ºoº  when exactly?



Like a yr ago



damn microsoft



Did u ever hear anyone say windows 10 is now free



Cos that's what they ment



yeah, but without the personalization things



but i dont think it'll affect me that much



I think if u download it and shove it on a flashdrave as an is for a pc, itl have a watermark in the bottom corner



@Towny its right before my race with cyclowns but i cant find the vod on your twitch



was that round 3?



I have an legitimate 8.1 copy, so I think I'll have an legitimate 10 too



r4 i think



Well glad you got the new os



thx



^^



no more suffering with incompatibility



I used to have a windows 7 laptop



Absolute nightmare



oh shit was it losers bracket



damn I deleted all those



I hope its not lost forever



jackass



dammit



Wtf are u guys on about



That was such a funny moment, and its gone



Rip funny moment I never saw, rip



got some strong opinions in the chat fuck merpell



FUCK MERPELL



damn it I think its gone forever



still in recycle bin maybe?



I clear my recycle bin religiously



Is it in a youtube video?



fuck



no it isnt



it was before the race



not to mention i cant even find me vs cyclowns on townys youtube anyway



The race itself didn't even make it in



I didn't put the losers matches up



I really should have saved those vods



I don't clear my deleted



this is tragic



If I wanna perma get rid of I shift delete



it's ok towny



Maybe cyclowns can do a retake for us



gone but never forgotten



how the fuck did no one clip that



i couldve sworn there was at least a clip



its okay I got a sound alert of zack saying "fuck you merpell" which is good enough ig



I mean



you literally live in the same house as him



you can just ask him to say it again



what I think you already did nvm



That race has so many clips



How many races have been done so far?



all of them



Was it u vs rtd



You think I live with cyclowns?



it was merpell vs cyclowns



no, zach



Wait so there's a losers bracket?



there was a losers bracket yeah



this was last tournament



O oi



Ok



Oh, no he was only staying at my house for a week before he moved to texas



hes gone now :YEPsad:



whereas rtd has free real estate in your head



im not gonna stream twitch today i decided



im gonna wait a bit



NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO:YEPsad: :trister: :pepehands:



SAD AF



i feel like a non veteran rn who is he



he can send you an audio file saying that tho



He's just an IRL friend. He doesn't even speedrun lol

:pogu:



the science behind it is that it gives u 10000000000% luck



if you have a lot of money and nothing to spend, nitro is a kinda ok thing, I only got it cuz it came free with game pass ultimate



i dont have nitro



why would i waste money on that shit

{Reactions}
omegalul 


wouldn't recommend buying



so true



server boosts are more worth it



might aswell buy thin air



even tho still overpriced



only get nitro if free like I did



how



i got nitro for 4 cents



how



one of my friends had a nitro gift



xbox game pass ultimate comes with 3 motnhs of free nitro



oh



and needed 4 cents in his account to buy pokemon sword



hmmm continue



im a nintendo kid



switched to pc tho

{Reactions}
6head 


so i gave hin four cents and he gave me the nitro gift



STONKS



im gonna go try get dat sub 4



cya



you'll get it ez clap



dont forget to bop doggo



thanks



i feel like my last good run was a complete fluke



so i dunno if im gonna get it soon



did u have lot of deaths on your pb?



cuz if u did, you can a get a new pb easily just by not dying a lot



a death can lose 2 to 6 seconds and even more depending on the level



you can get good to the point where every run will get you sub 4. You just gotta practice individual levels on the trainer and try to maximize your time on each level. Really grind that shit



ye will do



idk if my grinder will be able to grind my constipation :KEKW:

I think it's my leaving that causes wr at this point



this is seriously like the 5th time this has happened



never seen an rtd record live ngl



i saw the previous one



was lurking



That's epic



FINALLY I HAVE WINDOWS 10 LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



AND CONGRATS ON THE WR RTD LETSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO²



is it weird that I'm more excited about lycro getting windows 10 than rtd getting a pb



no



the wr didnt even break a second barrier



true



I mean rtd gets a pb every week, but you only get windows 10 once



so probably not no



FAX



i mean this was the the blandest pb i think i've ever gottne



exact same run



except like better 44



and better death on 41



and missed 29



and better 50



those are all of the relevant differences



In other bland news, I got a hard mode PB



died in the same levels, missed 6 wk, missed 34 wk, missed towny slide, almost identical 45's



2:04.08



oh gg thats pretty close to wr



hard m:omegalul:de



says the one who spent time playing it to get wr :omegalul:



windows 10 is so less clunky than 8.1



much more clean



yoo new world record

Yoooooo



rtd cant compare



he's so good wtf :pogu:



These new kids learn so fast



First ice discovers 50 SkipSkip



Then Copycat almost breaks the 3 min barrier



What's next? Monkeyboy winning the tournament?



Lol



how do I beat hard 8



By getting to the end smh



bRuH



just had an idea regarding gur bingo



to solve the linearity problem we could hold it on gurtrainer



so you can just pick the levels to do shit in



also allows for spaces that involve il times



e.g. sub 13 50, 2.97 10



oooo i like this



i'd def b down



going down the list of levels



- 1 Jumpless
- 4 w/o Middle Block (yes you can do this without hwk)
- 8 IHook Into Goal
- 10 in 2.97
- 11 HSG (:x:)
- 18 Underswing
- 21 Spinnerless (might be too easy, maybe add a time cap)
- 22 Die via Crushing (:x:)
- 25 Spinnerless (same as 21)
- 28 Jumpless
- 33 Touch Every Block
- 34 No Grapples
- True 36 Skip (might be too hard)
- 37 One Grapple (also might be too hard)
- 39 One Grapple (might be too long)
- Towny Slide
- 42 Sub-12 With >15 Jumps (also might be too long)
- 44 Skip Last Block
- 45 Land On Elevator (:x:)
- 46 Jump Off Falling Obstacle (:x:)
- 49 Bonkless
- Sub-13 50 (probably other stuff involving 50 that could be added)
- H1 Skip 2 Blocks
- H4 Wallkick (:x:)
- H9 <4 Spinners
- H11 Pillars Blockless (almost definitely too hard)
- Do a Swinghop (:x:)



❌ means you dont have to beat the level after doing the strat



how tf do you do 28 jumpless



o shit it's possible to get the 2nd block



grapple the top block from start, contract while holding left



oh i could add beat 1 jumpless



my best is 20 jumps on 42



you can get infinite jumps by just doing cycles on the first part



but that wastes time



ig u could add it has to be sub 21



idk if that could fit on a bingo card



"42 Sub-12 with >15 Jumps"



works



and punishes jumping before activating the moving block



Holy these bingo ideas are awesome doggo



Looking forward to that



isnt it like 4 am for you

you hate to see the 49 chokes



That was easy 2:29 pace



this is why you don't hold right on 49



2:21.22 thru 40



@csercser3 rtd doesnt have a hard mode pb you dont have to listen



thanks



everyone's ignoring the +7 48



nah thats just 48



well both r quite tragic



"never judge another man 48"



Holy just watched towny's run



I can get a 3:31 no cap



Imma grind the shit out of this game



Our things were very close if I get consistent LETSFUCKINGO



Thx for the motivating run towny



You got this bro, I believe in you!



Man



3:00 through 40



STILL DOESN'T BREAK 5



I once was stuck like this, but on the 4:30 range, I'd say: finish more runs



Even if you're red going 41-50



That will help your consistency a lot



I started doing that



I just always choke on a different level between 41-50



This time it was 45 and 48



Do not stop the grind and you'll get a fat recorded pb soon



Who knows? Next time I could choke on 41, 43 and 50



Time to grind a bit more



If you think you're going to choke it,it makes more likely that you choke



Train those levels until you feel confident on them



This time sub 3 through 40 and would have been sub 5 but I got impatient on 50 and died right at the end



That one felt really good through even though I messed up a few times



Man, sub 3 1-40 is low 4 pace, see what you can improve in your 41-50 and you're good to go!



I still wanna know why TAS contributor is higher than Sub 4 gang in the role hierarchy



tas contributor isnt hoisted to be fair



and by now finding improvements in the tas is arguably harder than top 10 lol



Hmmmmmm makes sense even tho kinda strange but you got a point



Nuclear take: Showing roles on the sidebar is stupid anyway



scalding take



it's a nuclear take because it sucks

if we ever did bingo youd probably be the one to host it so thought you should see it



Yeah I agree with having it on gurtrainer, it makes most sense



are all the space ideas good



bingo challenge: tas a sub-2 sec level 2 by hand



tas competitions could actually be hype



especially with custom levels

i think 27th place



Congrats on the run man!



thanks'



First sub 5 huh



I remember when I got my first sub 5 I was so happy lol (then stopped playing for 6 months)



dang



Do not stop the grind, it only hurts your gameplay



fr



Don't do what I did lol



i recorded it on my phone lol



I wonder if they will accept it



GGs ma boey



@merpell  will probably accept there's no reason to do not do it



If it's showing everything, and no cuts



allegedly will accept



HMMM



I think that recording with your phone is even more reliable since you show your setup and (I suppose) your hands



didnt merpell have a phone recorded pb



im pretty sure hes going to accept it



idk



i have several



ill uploadit



if its a full video its all good



k



idgaf if you recorded it on a camcorder from the 90s



lets goo



I used my I phone lol



there is also alot of backround noise



i mute anyways idc



Top 10 most dedicated moderators



bottom 10*



Yo merpell, how did u became a moderator? My guess is that Zach wasn't that active in GUR and since you had just broken the WR he was like, here boy make good use of it



How was it?



nah jumpyluff made me mod after i got wr in gur2



but still gur2 sucks



°o° mod backstory



didnt even know you had gur2 wr at one point



toxic



4:42:470 ms is the run time



Neither did I



i had it for a few days



so i dont blame you



only for a few days that is



soon we will forget that merpell had the gur1 wr at one point



nah bro



you'll see that huge arcanod line and think "who was the sexy man who dethroned the king?"



this is the pic proof, but the video is uploading to youtube rn

dont mind the other vids



Pogchomp



young g george



Now, I'm obligated to ask



Sub 4 when



Dont mind it



what is sub 4?



Less than 4 minutes



the fourth version of the submarine



You have much to learn



-Yoda



Sub something is getting below the number presented: ex: sub 3:30 is getting a time below 3:30, like a 3:28



too complicated



for me to understand\



fancy talk



Ok, but, sub 4 when?



Sub4 = getting a time below 4 minutes



ohhhhhh



ok



is it not sub 4 seconds???

{Reactions}
allegedly (2) 


ahh that makes more sense



sub 4 gang seems a lot less impressive now



Have to admit



Wait, if sub4 is not 4 seconds wtf is sub27



csers dmvt record



ooff



The toxicity



I played for 20 mins the other day and the max I got was a 25



I'll play more in the future



not bad, but needs improvement



I mean, for 20 minutes of total playtime it's ok



towny hard mode



aww, you think im not bad? 🙂



dont get your hopes up



i mean you got 3rd place today



not in hard mode



i cant talk shit about his normal pb



even if it does suck

oh



Lmao I've laughed so much watching my first run



Yo daveed



My game froze 3 times



You can hear all my family watching tv



My English is complete garbage



I took 1:30 mins to beat lvl 50



yes



I've always thought your english was rather good. Is learning english compulsory in your schools?



I take English classes since I was 8



Im almost finishing my English course



I think they told me that I'm going to finish it in 1 and a half year I think



My school have english, but its the basic shit only ya know



The book is on the table and etc



Oh your English classes are separate from school?



Yes



cool



My dad put me in some english classes cuz he said that in the future aot of jobs would require it



And damn was he right



It's a good move, english is the international business language. It'll open up so many doors just knowing it



But most of my English learning came from watching a lot of youtube



I watch mostly english videos only



Exactly, I think the best thing that the classes do is teaching the grammar



Cuz like, most people say that you can learn just by watching things in english, and that's kinda true



But the grammar is much more learned in the english classes imo



Yeah especially when you're young, humans are hard wired to learn language naturally



I wish I knew 2 languages



That would be cool



My dad started taking English classes  at the same time as me, he was 35 at the time, so It's never late to start learning it ma boey



He says that it's harder for him since he's not young and all but he speaks English very well



You should learn spanish, cuz it's one of the most used languages in the world and it's much easier than mandarim and even portuguese



Portuguese is one of the hardest languages in the world btw



I know a little spanish from the 2 years they make you take in high school



but just basic shit



hola



como estas



muy bien



my llamo mateo



me*



I know very little about spanish



Cuz my school does not spanish classes (thanks god)



spanish :lul:



you probably learn french, right?



oui



i forgot pretty much everything



makes sense, since there are so many french in canada



ca va bien?



Portuguese looks kinda close to spanish in the grammar but it's speaken completely different



me gusta



For example, the sentence you wrote in spanish goes like this in pt:



Olá, como vai?
Estou bem
Me chamo Matheus



You can see the similarities, but they're very distinct



And (no brag intended) portuguese is a much richer language than spanish



Yes I've heard spanish is rather bland



Yeah, it is



And I think you don't change personal names when talking in another language



i know, I've just always liked mateo lol



Like, my name (Pedro) in the english way of speaking it would be Peter, but you just speak it normally



MateoPog



Here it'd be Matheus



I got a hard mode PB :POGGERS:



2:02.48



LESSGOOOOOOOOO



:POGGERS: :pissball: ?



Grats on the PB again Cser!



I'm coming for merpell



Sub 2 when?



:POGGERS: :silverball:



Merpell bop when?



hard mode :lul:



:LELW:



yea imagine playing hardmode



wr holder must be a huge loser



its true

46 screwed me over, but that's fixable!

Yo Cser how do I put a segment timer below the main one?



detailed timer instead of timer

Yo @hetheis do you have a twin brother and never told us?



YOOOOOOOOOO



Was goooood @River



I have no idea who he is lol



lmao



Ya we dont know each other



Lol



Yo river what's your pb? If you have one already



One question



Why does everyone freak out over particles being on?



5.45.250



But that was liie a year ago



Like*



Ive gotten back in it recently



Cuz particles are trash
Ugly
Trash



if lyrco disses particles



you know they suck



yo how do you do the towny slide?



hsg



you just grab onto the bottom part of that ground



and last few frames of the platform before it goes up top



release the grapple



like any other hsg



what is a hsg



the strat you do in 24



oh ok



I just watch the wr how tf



Yall found some new stuff in the past year



yup



yep



if you wanna see extra new stuff you should see the tas



:pogu:



<https://youtu.be/gHFIneZz5yw>



If I had not found that video by scrolling in youtube, I would not know any of you



thank god for me randomly scrolling on yt



How do u do the wall jump



you mean wall kick?



I think



if so you gotta ask towny or sesual



Ok



Hold up against a wall, and press the grapple key for exactly 2 frames



How long did it take yall to achieve it



Well we found that spamming grapple against a wall caused robot to shoot out sometimes. It wasn't until like a month later we decided to actually try to abuse it



but once we applied ourselves, it was really quick



Ok ill need to try



going thru my files and found this

wish me lucc



YOOO GOOD LUCK ON THE GRAND FINALS  DIG!



YOU GOT THIS



yeaaa



yo @Doggo do you have that min. grapples and jump sheets? that you sent screenshots here on discord



its just a top 5 player vs a guy that hold 7 world records



and im not the guy that holds 7 world records



but



is he *on fire*?



uh



he gets top 3 times on the daily



consistently



might be hard but i believe



I mean, you're the underdog, maybe the pressure gets to him



or he may understimate you



i believe in the power of the choke



and I believe in your habilities GL!



BUT



he's undertrained



he doesnt practice any%



and i just got a pb today



so i think its a bit of an equal



WOW



so YOU are ON FIRE BABY



yeaaaa



gonna get this w



but, dont get overconfident, with confidence comes disappointment



thats the hard balance of life



but I trust you anyways so the W will be ez



i love lycro philosophy



philosiphy is lycro



lycrolosophy



"Go slow, it saves time"



it worked for me at the time :KEKW:



actually facts though



stoping at 25 = saving time



KEKEEKEKEKEK



should have gone slow on 45 in my race



what I meant is that you could die very easily in 44 if you go too fast and you cant go foward to reach the end



My hubris :pepehands:



I used to lose a lot of runs that way, but now I got the hang of it

thanks Xx_SniperGod69_xX for the 5 dollars



yo, I used fraps to see my fps at GUR, and it's 35-40 fps wtf



how much fps do you guys average on gur?



I should check



this fps is kinda strange



should be higher



hmmmmm



its just cause flash sucks. gurtrainer should run 60



how do i get fraps to focus on flash?



yes, gurtrainer is running at 60 fps



Alt+enter



then it'll focus on flash



whats your fps on flash towny?



cant get it to display



alt enter does nothing



ctrl f fullscreens but it still wont display



alt enter should fullscreen



it doesn't



do you have the fps counter on in fraps?



yes it's enabled



it comes unchecked when you download it I think



hmmmm strange



nvm it works now for whatever reason



noice



how much?



I just had to enable hardware acceleration



lemme check



yeah im averaging around 40



I wish someone would make an exe already



I wanna play at 60



oh, k then, I was starting to get worried about my pc performance



me too ;-;



.exe when?



yeah nah man it's just flash



gur 120fps when



it doesn't run much faster on exe



its still flash just bundled



It does run smoother



like, noticably



that's why I train on GURtrainer 2.0 instead of 3.0, the higher framerate and fullscreen makes it different from the real deal and fucks my muscle memory



I can tell the difference between gurtrainer and the swf just by looking at it



yeah but it's not gonna push it to 60 just by existing



i think adobe air just has a better runtime



oh okay, so adobe air is why gurtrainer runs at 60?



yea



well we should make an adobe air version then



I just wanna run at 60 :YEPsad:



I like the idea, but generally modifying the game like this doesn't end well



i would but i think i need adobe software foe it and my isp yelled at me last time i pirated something



I mean, you got the gurtrainer working fine



I mean about modifications, and people modificating the game to cheat



its honestly easier to modify the swf



but idk much about it



so I can't really give an opinion here



its better for me to be quiet in this conversation



one issue is we have to refind pointerpaths so the autosplitter works



but that's not tooooo bad



that's true



would you have to rewrite the script, or just replace some variables?



just add some variables



its actually a lot easier cause you know the last 3 offsets




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/801164558810349568/unknown.png



or last 4



what is that



memory addresses



dont know what that means



I'm assuming that's code from the autosplitter that's showing where in the memory the values are



but idk the code at all



everyone try and do 22 without activatin the blocks]



match is in a few minutes



if i win this im gonna shoutout lycro after the race



too ez when you have lycrop1 on your side



wait is a rce happening??



when??????



no its a 63 race



sm63



oh



finals

if u dont, are you going to roast me? (stonks)

If we can go back to the menu by hitting ESC, we won't need to close the .exe to retry, right? And if that's right, the new autosplitter will restart when we hit esc or when we start a new run?



And,will the .exe be allowed to be used in the tournament?



Cuz like, it's very close, may have some bugs in it, or crash midway race ya know



New software things



it's essentially the same file, just runs on a different version of flash which is why it runs smoother



so it shouldnt crash at all



I'm fine with allowing it during the tourney



no autosplitter now wahooo



yipeeee



There will be an autosplitter still, just need to be updated



but u can go strait to menu



Oh, k then hyped AF to play with it



straght



i cant spell



straight



there we go



there we go



Yeah, but the autosplitter will continue to be used



welp im gonna continue my journey to bop doggo



on the exe



cya



Yo does the .exe have an windowed borderless option?



Cuz I can't make my livesplit appear in any fullscreen app ;-;



If you guys know how to do it pls help



get 2 monitors



I do not have the space on my desk ;-;



Neither the monitor ;-;



What can I do pls welp



two moniters are expensive as hell



play windowed lol



not if you get a crappy used one for like 30 bucks



@SensualPudding do u think yul make an exe gur trainer?



But I want the borderless smh



There's one already



GURTrainer 3.0



wait rly?



ya



link?



Yeah, for a long time now



On SRC resources page



On*



Will I have to play it windowed with the borders still? :PepeHands:



There exist one but it's not acceptable for any leaderboards

Maybe I'll create an exe for ILs some day don't know



Im very happy with the .exe decision, not only for quality of life but preservation reasons too, cuz like, even tho we can still play in flash player just fine, we dont know if in the future some windows update could make flash player unplayable (even older versions) or smth like that, It'll be a smoother experience in the future too



Very happy even tho I'm still a windowed MF :PepeHands:



its still flash



just bundled using air



Yeah, I got it, just saying it's better for preservation and yada yada



if you guys want i can make the leaderboard show platforms as well



where normal flash would be web and the exe would be pc



something like that



ehh, I mean since they don't have a significant difference, I don't see a reason to put them up



what are the differences?



exe runs better



thats about it



just tossing ideas around



doesn't give any advantage to igt though



dont almost all games show platform even if theyre identical



it cant hurt to show platform can it



i dont think the leaderboards should be seperate, but just have it written



thats what i meant



i cant download it rn bc dorm internet is weird :pensive_cowboy:



discord works fine but cant connect to any sites



Yeah I'm not opposed to showing the version



Technically exe gives you a disadvantage
Like wk is still just 2 frames, but they go quicker. Do would be harder



I personally would vote for showing versions



well i was actually thinking about this



I always practice on the trainer before i do runs on flashplayer



hsgs and wallkicks feel the same difficulty and there's not really any adjustment



i think on the normal flash player its still the 2 frame hold @60fps but it just runs at ~40ish or whatever



so you just might not see the frame where the wallkick actually happens



i dont think the raw time you have to hold z for actually gets changed



yea i would guess something like that



cause 40 fps to 60 should be a pretty noticeable difference



just choked a 3:34 to a limp hsg pepehands

anyway  i died like 10 times on 43



noice!



that shows thats improvable! and thats good



but 2:41 is good af



wish I had that time in so little time playing



im getting pretty good at 1-40



i just  barely finish any runs becuase i keep messing up 41-50



Towny slide is the most satisfying glitch to pull off

{Reactions}
peepoLove 


50 hsg is much more satisfying imo



the pure joy of seeing your robot fly to the finish line and get a new pb is just different



doing both 34 wk's bring joy



which one was 34 again?



oh the one with the saw in the middle



the middle of 34 is empty af



no, the one where the ceilling falls



falls*



waht



smaller than 36



which one was 36 again



square, where the ceilling falls when you grapple it



you're thinking of 32 dignity



hmmm



with lava all around it



oh that one



yep



the one with the 3 squres?



wait no thats 25

Cyclowns has never play GUR in his life, you're good dude

Hey guys, we should start a google doc spreadsheet of challenges



Might be a useful reference when we do GUR bingo too



I agree



Can one of you zoomers whip one up real quick, thx



you callin me a zoomer towny?



i got a challenge, beat gur using the hardest strat for every level. but if u get 1 death u fail

GUR Challenges
Jump Low%



can I add a challenge sheet?



What I mean is, a board where people can post challenges, and then everyone compete for the best time



Like, for instance wakeless 22



Sure



Should each category be on a different sheet?



Nah cause there are a lot, and it'll be better to have them in a list



Ok



wakeless 22?



Yeah, beat the level without activation any of the moving blocks



sounds hard



It's tough, but easy to get used to



Pinned a message.



You guys can feel free to add any challenges you had in mind



Doggo had ^this list



yeah I'm gonna add all those



Isn't 11 possible jumpless?



how would a gur randomizer work



Yknow I'm just gonna rename these to gur bingo ideas



Think so, think maistlin took away a lot of jumps from that thingie some time ago, Inc the 11 one



Ok



It is possible



Hsg trick



maistlin did 11 jumpless



with hsg at the end



Is the minimum jumps for lvl 6 two?



yeah pretty sure



got my first  28

Congrats on the 28 though



It took me to long to find this video



Maistlin really is a god at this game isn't he?



which is why he has like 15 il records



Yep



first 58 for 20 levels

What is true 36 skip?



the one swing?



idk



one swing one jump



okay



ya that one



does the bingo have to be in a run or can you just post a video of the individual level



what



idk tbh, I don't know the bingo system works



you like.



fill a bingo board with 25 of the things



its usually like a race



and then compete with someone else to see who can get a bingo faster



ah okay



woop woop



for the minimun jump catagory, wouldn't like 16 be possible with 0 instead of 2 with swinghop?



yes



actually its feasible that you can do 10 in zero



id have to check



ok a swinghop in 10 is possible



chances that it can be vertical enough for this are not high

wait is that wr



nooo rippp



Sadly not



seconds away



I'm coming for it though



congrats tho still



damnnnn gg



you have successfully re-scared me



jesus christ



Have to be really good to beat you though, almost always have to be deathless to get close and you can die a few times and still get great times

With a better 18 i would've taken wr rhough



is the recording scuffed again



Nope, last time my computer couldn't handle it, had a game open in the background that I closed at the last time. This time it looks good

why were you on the intro for that long



Where I at the intro for long?



at the part with the intro ?



you stayed on it for long enough for the first line to play



basically everyone else just like mashes enter for every attempt



oh nice 28 wk lol



I usually don't wanna stress myself to death, I think I take a lil longer on each 10 screen as well



yeah



this man first tried every rta viable wallkick what the fuck



Yeah, I don't know where I lost so much time not to get wr, felt really good



wouldve gotten wr if you did fast last pillars 4Head



Yeah I scuffed it, grabbed to low



wait were you actually going for it



i was memeing lmao



I were going for the first 2, so like grab first and 3rd



oh that



still sounds really hard



but probably manageable



bruh that 45 what



should've been recording input display idk how you stayed on the corner like that



Lol yeah that really close, didn't see that. I don't think I did anything special.



btw can confirm that if 10 jumpless is possible it is not anything that ive thought of



i spent most of my time trying to get an hsg but theres just no way to line it up without getting roboglued



swinghop is definitely out of the question



oyea that's kinda confusing your 41-50 was a 1:06 which is kinda slow



and the only level you made a mistake on was 50



and maybe 41



I mean 45 was like 20sec+ so like half a sec there as well



ah rly it didn't look that slow



didnt jump + bad angle on 41, late grapple at the end of 43, late grapple at the start of 45 + weak grapple at the end, didnt jump in 47, held grapple for a while at the end of 48



its just small optimizations adding up i think



same probably goes for why the run didnt wr



Oh yeah, when you put it like that there's a lot of improvement



I didn't put that because I only wanted to put stuff that's been done RTA, and I don't think it has been done



YOOOOOOOO GRATS ON THE PB SENSUAL!

That was painful to watch



but that was good pace going into 50



Oh no, FeelsBadMan



lost about 7 seconds to deaths that run



>.<



owch



Oof that sucks



YO I just did the towny slide



Good job bro 👍



what about the towny jog???



@pansear ❤  try doing the first part in fewer swings



you don't have to awkwardly dodge each pillar that way



I feel the 2swing method to be most consistent, even tho takes some time to get the feel for it



I'd say that I rarely miss it, but if I say it imma die to it 10x in the tourney



Just so you guys know, my computer sux, so I’m getting a second discord so I can show my computer screen and talk at the same time. (The mic is completely kaput)

Well luckily you can still improve alot



ye at least I improved



I was pissed I wasnt recording though



congrats on the pb copycat



@Towny  can u tech me how to do wks?



stand next to wall while holding up, press grapple for 2 frames



i still dont get it



he said he'd teach me



There's not much more to it, what is happening to your wks that are failing?



Are you hitting the spinner and dying in 23?



If you are, try pressing z earlier



Cuz you need to bounce of the floor to pass on 23 and 32



you don't need to



but it's faster to

i released Z and it kept that way



no grapple and shaking lmao



magic



yeah we've found this before



i needed to press Z again to go back to normal



did u guys discovered why it happens?



Nope, didn't seem to useful



but who knows



maybe we unlock the secret of wrong warp



to wrong warp you have to finish level 52



then wk off of the void



Could be useful for a dance off in worst case



looks like he's  scared lmao



like when pets put their ears down, but he's outting his antenna down



yo merpell, I'm curious to know, do you receive a notification on SRC when someone's run gets unlisted or deleted of youtube or twitch?



cuz like, I imagine that some leaderboards may get a lot of runs unlisted runs as the time goes on



nope



oh wow



Okay hear me out on this one, wk level 31?

pogu (2) 


mark my words



of course I might sub 4 first run but yeah no lol



I need to be prepared going against flanc and maybe klice if I win



Yo @Dignity , as I ultimately failed, I ask you something, please, beat the shit out of Flanc, and @csercser3 do what you do best



I WANNA SEE THIS TOURNAMENT BURN BABY



:peepoBlanket: :allegedly:



LETS FUCKING GO



probably won't even be balanced out of tomorrow lol



I'll grind a lot of gur



The prophet has spoken



Please, honor my death, cheeseman, change da world, my final message



I sit on my bed
After a long day
Practice GUR,
Or watch anime?

~Monkeyboy432



why not both



bro



i was about to type that



i play gur and watch anime at the same time all the time



woah, really?



I have to read subs so I can't do both



no it's kinda possible still



ig you can't get the full experience though



v efficient time usage tho



I suppose lol. Until I get 50 down, I will dedicate time to gur alone tho 😄



Not to mention I'm racing tomorrow :/



Accept the monke inside you, and the dub will come



I failed to reject humanity



You’re not human so it’s fine



What am I then 🤔

Well you’re a god amongst men. You seem to forget about your cult sometimes.

@icecube5011 Depends on what genre you like. Would you rather see people beat each other up to death, or a romance?



People beat each other up to death



I'm a decent person like that



Lmao. That’s not my preferred genre, but definitely watch one punch man.



Death note is action, but it’s more intellectual action. It’s like watching supernatural chess.



then why would i watch it instead of gameplay of 5d chess with multidimensional time travel



There’s not nearly as much death in normal 5d chess :3



fair



death note is kinda boring



It’s boring at times, yeah. It’s watching a dude write names down with dramatic music in the background.



It’s a good watch if you pay full attention. One punch man is more fun tho



5 deaths at 40 and 4 deaths at 46

Is this rta viable?



extremely doubtful



its probably il viable



Oyea i forgot u can’t even see at the start of 1



brushing up against the wall at the start actually makes it more consistent so maybe that doesnt matter much



also i think towny slide being a 2 frame window isnt for the reason we think



because this is also a 2 frame window



i think its because the snap roboglues you onto the ground and kills your monentum



whereas in levels like 24 the snap just sends you through the air



@Towny two hours to go



is it bad that that i think that looks easier



than 1 normally?



yes that is very bad



its easier than 1 wallkick though



you have like   a frame for each of those jumps



the first jump is frame perfect both for when you press and when you release



if you release one frame sooner you bonk and if you release one frame later you overshoot



and i think if you jump one frame late you bonk no matter what



that or you go over the gap and your jump gets eaten



oh



Good morning people



holy shit

fucking finally



5sec of timeloss to 48 btw



:POGGERS:



:allegedly:

{Reactions}
allegedly 


i had a bad death on 48 and then i did it the safe weay



so i lost like 5-6 secs



the rest of the run was clean asf



is there such thing as a good 48 death



I picked a bad day to retire



guess im back on my gur shit



it was bound to happen eventually



CONGRATS CYCLUTCH :POGGERS:

{Reactions}
POGGERS 


gur exe made me like 10x more consistent at wks



idk why



i hit 22 wk like 5 times in a row



I feel like I'm less consistent on exe



i wont let myself be mad at that 48 timeloss because this is a good time



instead i will motivate myself to get 3:1x before rtd



YOOOOOOOO CYC



GRATS ON THE PB



and fuck 48



BUT GRATS ON THE SUB 330



I guess I ain't going shit far from GUR



DO IT FOR YOUR GF :pogu:



lol a couple hrs ago she was like 'yo you should try and get a record again'



and i was like why not ill do some runs today



still need 2 grind more



and finish autosplitter but



i'll be so sad if you or sensual get 1x before me



ig i gotta get there soon



revenge for you bopping my shitty world record like 2 years ago



sensual does like 1 run every 3 months and PBs by 5+ seconds



so you got some time



yea i remember seeing your 4 flat time and doing runs cause i rly wanted to get sub4 first



now it's sub 3:20



Just as rtd said he'd maybe get a lil break from GUR, cyclowns come and makes him run for his life



its not that much of a threat



3:28



With a 5+ 48



im guessing 5 secs, maybe less



Which is basically luck, so pretty close if you ask me



but it seems around there



Probably



i remember losing sub4 to two 48 deaths :pepehands: :peepoSad:



everyone forgets the merpell 4:02



wasnt even the 4:02 smh



well the 4:02 is the one that motivated me



to play more



ABSOLUTE MOTIVATOR



the merpell 4:02 was the first GUR speedrun I ever watched



It was inspirational



4:02 was the run that made me go "wtf other people play this game"



still gets 50 views a month



through sheer will and tenacity



i still get comments on my 3:47 like "bro nice run"



thank you sir however the world record is 25 seconds better now



is the wr deathless tho



TRUUUEEE



does the WR miss the spinner on 25



:peepoSad:



bruh yt analytics are fire



now i know that there was a random spike of views on my channel on april 18th 2020 for literally no reason



those were all me



nah but my views literally quintupled for 3 days straight



during which no videos were made



0:33 this might be fake or tas. It shows him holding the arrow key but if you actually did this it would make you walk right off the edge. This happens a few other times as well Try it 1:07 this death may have been to cover it up, look how easily avoidable it was. Maybe not but still. I could be wrong because level 50 looks pretty planned out.



lmao i remember thinking "what a fucking tard has he ever played this game"



I don't care about all this bullshit I still wanna know how the fuck did he walk on the spinners on 22



because merpell hacked



duh



checks out



Its so obvious



Your patience for these mouthbreathers is commendable tho 👏



his insidious cheating allowed him to hold right on a platform for absolutely no gain



what a devil



That was to cover him smh



He cheated on another levels too

":KEKW: I'VE DONE IT :KEKW: "



good job tho fr



wks have finally clicked for me



the goal is to tap a as light as possible



I always slam it on the controller lol



but like, really quickly



let go of right after the first grapple



and its free



and hold up on the grapple



you'll get positioned under the block nicely



i just realised wks are pretty much pointless for 23



Nah, they save a whole second



it saves like a second



32 saves like 3



im gonna use 32 wk



32 by far the most worth wk in the game yeah



not 23



23 its not worth the risk



23 is second most worth thouth



agreed



ah fuck I still need to make my wallkicks video



remind me tomorrow



32 > 23 > 29 > 6 > 22 > 36 > 34 > 5



wouldent wks be easier if u had a mechanical keyboard



cos u can do lighter inputs on a mechanical



i got a 7:52 on 29 is that gud?



i got a 7:52 on 29 is that gud?



Depends who you ask



i also got a 6



I think a mid-6 second is good



my gold is 6:02



a sub 7 seconds I would say is good



Yeah it totally depends. 29 can be fast in so many different ways for different people



good enough anyway



the il is sub 5 i think



woop woop i just did a 22 wk



but the il is insane



Practice two swings in the first corridor of 29



fuck two swing



It's really easy though



I hate it, don't wanna risk it on a good run



I always go pretty safe on 29,really dislike that level



I found that a well placed first grapple makes the two swing free as hell



i used to despise 29 but now that im doing the wk im fine with it



but two swing would probably make me hate it again



in my opinion 22 is the hardest wk level



i havent done all levels so i cant say shit but



nah 36 is much harder



they're both hard though

i have a mechanical and i do WKs by slamming really hard on Z/X



so who knows



if i try and do it lightly it just doesnt work



and if i try and only press Z i cant get it



so i will stick with my method



how Do I use that?



dowload the flash projector



download the swf



open the swf in the flash projector



i think



says I gotta download smthn to use it



Yh flash



but since I use A touch screen chromebook I can just zoom in



and flash still works on blips



so imma keep using blipz

I'm worried that I'll just reach a point where I run out of strays and it gets rly hard



yep



:)



Oh I'm still gonna kick ur ass tho



young man



:allegedly:



I am a man that is young



just lost a 3:33 to 49



NOICE



Dang



That sucks



yeah, at least I learned that I gotta train it more



even tho its free af



49 is always free unless you're on pb pace. Somehow people die on it all the time



yo @rtdrtd67 I'm trying 22wk and a lot the times I'm going too slow and dying to the mid lava, what am I doing wrong?



yeah, so strange



^ this is accurate



I literally just died on 49 on PB pace



yo @SensualPudding next gurtrainer version suggestion: put a little T or something to differentiate the trainer from the actual game, cuz rn they look the same lol

not a big deal but it'd be helpful



now I know how you feel



Oh yeah that's a good idea
I'll write it up

If anyone wants to make a custom icon I'll gladly use it too



Classic 49



what about something like this with the robot's head kinda peeping on the bottom right?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/803389998136426516/unknown.png



I made this one just to show my idea



As long as you can read it, could try it out



I know its not centered, and not even a square kekw



yeah, thats my biggest concern



cuz like, as a desktop icon



it'd be very hard to read it



so text isn't a good idea I guess hmmmmmmmmmm



Yeah that's what I though. Esspecially if you got like Windows at 100% on a 4k monitor or something. Don't have that so can't test but would assume it would just be a scramble



But like the idea
Maybe could just be like 4.0 or something
Just to indicate



that means you are probably pressing z to early, try to do the ceiling kick when you're more inside of the ceiling if ykwim



HMMMMMMMMM later then? k lemme try it



yo, does anybody have a png of the robot?



There exist a few at the assets. Cyclowns have the source at his github.



what the font?



what about something like this? I'm not really familiar with edting images, so idk how to make the robot bigger without deforming it (this is a scratch)

in case you're wondering he's 8



lmao



there is no way he sits through the whole game



I say he gives up on 46



41



40



42



teach him towny slide



he was stuck in 25 for 7 mins and I wanted to play so he stopped



but he wanted to play more



he was doing well kinda of



tell him to stop before grabbing the spinner, it saves time



did he do 24 hsg



he cant get past the first lava part



no, he's an arcanod fan



50 skip



he found it too easy



but I saw him walk on the spinners on 22 :YEPsad:



my brother's a cheater i cant believe it



so young and it's so corrupted already



Joined the server.



sup



hi



how ya doin



doin good



how did u find  GUR? (or re-find in most cases)



i was going through my yt vids and remembered i used to semi-seriously speedrun this back in the day



like 2 yrs ago



so i checked the leaderboard and the times improved a lot



oh nice! whats your name on the leaderboards? and whats ur pb?



oh i dont remember let me check quickly



im MisterPoen on the leaderboards, PB is 4.48.520



its bad ik



1s slower than mine gg



lol



quick question how do you do the thing where you fly across a level



wallkick



or hsg



thats a great time!



wallkicks are frame perfect



which level?



hsgs have a 6 frame window



22 for example



thanks :)



thats a wr level strat



that's called a wk



frame perfect walljump iirc



wallkick srry



wallkick



ah right I'll ignore that for now then



no



wait



some wk's are easier than other



s



lycro dont teach him 22



xD



teach him like



24



the wk on 23 is not hard



24 is an HSG



24 is best



yeah but



all wks suck



no wks



hsg means?



wk's are free lmao



suck



hsg means uh



Hyper Speed Grapple



idk what it stands for



ahh ty



oh hyper speed grapple



24 hsg is pretty free



it works like this:
when you try to retract your grapple, the game tries to push you in a straight line into the end of the grapple, but there's something in front of it, (like the block on 24) the game can only move you sideways, and then the upwards velocity is  kept, so if you release the grapple in 6 firt frames you can use all the vertical speed to get to the top of the level



its not hard at all, believe me



you can try it yourself and see



ahh ok ill try



just a 6 frame window so its easy



43 and 46 HSG are way harder since the blocks in which you HSG are moving, so wouldn't recommend it until you have a low 4



oki thanks



and 23 and 32 wk are not that hard



to wk you have to go very close to wall, hold up and then press Z for exactly 2 frames



I just tap it very lightly and it's kinda consistent for me



lol i go for 43 and 46 rn



i get the trick but i keep just missing the top of the level lol



wait i can just grapple lol im not smart



sick



also if you haven't check out resources on src



so u can get the goods from the sensual shop



that literally means sexual shop rtd



ye im on the exe



might wanna word that better



good idea dignity



sexual marketplace



the pudding shop



i mean



pep's pfp is a dick so it doesnt matter lol



me and a friend were playing skribbl its supposed to be a goomba but yeah lmao



pretty bad drawing skills man



we were like half joking t was a good time



arcanod has a pretty good beginner route to start with



so which HSG are "beginner friendly"



oh



none



you dont really wanna do hsg's now



i mean level 24 is lalright



you can do that



24 is the easiest no doubt



heck, i do that



oki



not too hard to learn



thats def one you can do



not 43 and 46



dont be me



honestly 43 hsg isnt too bad



man let him get a low 4:x



what about 50fast? do you do it?



yeah i try



mmmm i hate fast 50



yo, straight talk rn: at the start 50fast may save only like 5 secs cuz you'll probably do it a little slow, but the sooner you start doing it, the better you will get at it and it can save up to 12 secs



and ah, 50hsg saves a lot of time



would totally do it



yeah do 50hsg



but not fast 50



is 50 hsg on of the hard ones



no



its risky, but not hard



I'd recommend doing it as soon as possible, cuz you''l get used to it faster



but do what you feel comfortable



ill just practice the shit out of 50 with the trainer



50hsg is pretty safe if you get the hang of it



it may look kinda scary since its the last input of the run



but it's 100% worth it



and 50fast, if you're comfortable with it, start doing it as soon as possible, so you don't regret taking so long to learn it like me



yeah im doing 50fast



well doing



trying



lol



22skip is also free



yeah



not the wk, the skip at the middle



i hate it but its free



oh yeah where you line up with the blocks



yeah i did that one



uh



the first falling block



jump onto the 2nd falling block there



go to the 3rd falling block



then back



and in case you didn't know it...



22 skip is one of the fundamental strats that make up a modern Give Up, Robot speedrun. On average this trick will save you about 3 seconds over the old method, shown here. Now, the new method. So, the main goal is to slide between these two spinners. It's a pixel perfect gap, so it needs to be lined up using this block. Let's start with the fundamentals. There are 4 blocks that make up this platform, each will fall independently when touched. The procedure in this trick is to jump over the firs



FUCK YOU



HEUEHUEHUEHEUHEUHEUEHE



anyways



then go back



ye ye



you should bump into the 1st one



release all input



yeah remember when i said i did that one xD



and you should get it



you can do a swing on the saw for swag but it doesnt matter at our level



I just golded 41-50 while I was +28



wow

STRONG OPINIONS



trainer is allowed for runs right?



nope



the exe is though



oh ok



there's an autosplitter on livesplit for the flashplayer though



IL runs, yes



nope



not allowed for ILs



wait waht



wasnt it allowed for individual level runs



it does say eligible for IL on the site



wait



nvm,



im blind



my bad



wait



oh nvm lol



3.0 cant be used for ils



1.0 and 2.0 are fine



oya the only trainer that exists for me is 3.0



sexpudding probably has 1 and 2



yea theres a new exe ver for the game



that runs as smooth as trainer



oh game timer makes it lag



you dont need game timer to verify runs right



as long as you show the time at the end you're good



oki thanks



Wait, game timer makes the game lag on .exe?



it makes it less smooth for sure



I run GUR since 2019



Merpell does it since I Think 2017



Holy I need to test that



I've always played with game timer on so Ive never really experienced it without it



For like, long periods of time



I'll test when I get into my pc



haha yeah do that



atleast for me its a noticable difference

Nice!!



holyshit



That's what I mean when I say 11 one swing



thats sick wow



The run is so bad I can be -4.65 through 3



Hard mode wr incoming?



Insane 11 one swing wtf



If I do that with a normal lvl 2 and 3 I get wr



or instead of 11 one swing I can go over the block on 7



Yo, did u guys see that celeste classic 2 came out as a birthday special of the 3rd anniversary of celeste?



It has to do with grapples too



Even tho it's vastly different



oooo



ill check out out



yeah you only have a horizontal grapple



and it works like an actual grappling hook lol



dont like the game a lot  but its nice that they made it



Joined the server.



sup



@SensualPudding ik this would be hard, but it would be cool if u rewrote gur with an accessable assets folder so u can get texture packs and shit



I mean i could add so everyone could like change skins etc. Maybe
I'll write that up as well



Don't know if enough people would use it though
But I'll think about it. Have thought about it before but was a small pain



the multicolored game blocks probably follow a simple pattern of repeated basic blocks



im no coder or anything but i think it would be possible to re - texture the blocks



i think a texture pack would be good cos the normal game style burns my eyes



Yup, yeah it would be that hard really
Except if have to make a few textures pic each and a good GUI to change them etc. Would be impossible just a lil annoying since I'm no grsphics designer



I mean it would be for the trainer though. So wouldn't be accepted for runs



ah



Maybe IL but absolutely not full games. That's for sure



if the game uses the same assets for every level then couldent u just change the color of the core asset then it would work for all levels



if thats how it works



I mean yeah that would definer work. Just change the assets isn't a big deal. Not hard



maybe u could experiment sometime



im just curious



Yup, I'll do
I'll put it on my 4.0 list
Have other priorities first but I will definitely look intonit



thanks



are there gonna be three separate versions of it



one for runs, one for practice/ils, one for tas



im assuming the assets are all on one page then couldent someone grahb that page and retexture it



oh right the exe for runs is a separate project from 4.0 already right



Either that, or I test the shit out of it. Let the admins test it. And completely makes sure it works. So the TAS and IL could be the same. So it'll tell you if it's a TAS or not



if all the textures were on one sheet then i could re texture it



i mean my sisters taking graphics design for collage



Yeah all the textures are in one folder. Not to hard to find them. Should be in cyclowns github otherwise I can DM them to you



ok



is this a bug?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/803582564198514688/Picture1_2.png



bug or not its rly cool



holy shit what did u do



Yeah that's like a very strange bug



think it's when you press TAB on that screen



yh



i was on 50 i clicked tab then when it went to the good job robot screen i spammed tab



and so, a new star wars ship was invented



plz keep the bug in the game its so cool



theres only 3 things id really care about in a new gurtrainer



- make the level clear sound less ear-splitting
- fix the "score could not be shown due to tas usage" showing on every level bug
- make a more distinct difference between tas and non-tas (make tas robot red or something) and apply it when the tas is run back with T (this could also obsolete the "score could not be shown due to tas usage" screen completely)



also if tas and practice are going to be kept as one then give the option to not save completions in the tas folder



Turning the robot red is a good idea. Would also be easier to do. Thanks for that

The save I can change
There ixist a config file where you can set a limit to which inputs it's saves based on time. So like if you set it to 3 seconds all completions sub 3 seconds saves

Have to be done on every level individually though



I think that doing a separate version for TAS, and one for IL and practice is safer, but idk if it'll take too much time



Sensual if u made an in game timer for gur with the whole gold system would the runs still be eligible



nope
not for full game leaderboards
I don't think I'll ever make a new version accapted for full game



Sad



I think it might actually be a little bit easier because don't have to think about all combinations
Maybe I'll do that
Just like to keep the nbr of exes down

I feel like when I launch 4.0 I'll remove 1,2 and 3 from SRC to make it easier for new players.
In a perfect world 4 would have all the things from the other 3, either as oneIL and one TAS. Or just 1



Yeah, imo TAS should be a separate application at all, and be very clear, something like:

GUR TAS editor 1.0



And then we have 
GURTrainer 4.0 

which would be for practice and ILs but with 0 TAS capacity



And removing the older versions of GURTrainer may be a good idea



yeah, rn it's very confusing for new players which ones are good for IL and tas etc
So I think 2 is the best bet

Think 4.0 still will save inputs though. but only the best of each level. Incase someone finds something cool



But leave it as a link there, like:

GURTrainer legacy editions (outdated)



Just as the preservation ya know



Thats a great idea ngl



Okay I'll keep them but it'll make it confusing



I don't think so, cuz in the end would look like:



GURTrainer 4.0 (available for ILs)

GUR TAS Editor 1.0 (a GUR apliccation made for TASing the game)

GURTrainer Legacy editions (OUTDATED, USE 4.0)



But put all the old version downloads in a single link ya know



oh okay I get you
That would work



Like the giveuprobot.fun website



YAHOOOOO



that website is trash, but could be used as a server i guess



Just to storage the files



It's a cool and helpful thing to have

lil shits just get in the way



@Towny wk vid?



o ya



good lookin out homie



can someone help me with 20s



idk whats slowing me down



20 is rng



i always end up with a 57



like 11-20



or just 20



the main thing i see (from your pb run) is that sometimes you're jumping at the start of levels when you dont need to



namely 5, 14, 17



I wish I could say something, but I also dont know what I'm doing wrong to never get a 53



not doing doggo 13



53 is kinda just



fuck who invited doggo to talk about 11-20



a little rng



based on how good ur 20 is



yeah 20 is the only level in 11-20 that has any significance



its not hard to get if you do 6wk



fuck doggo 13, all my homies hate doggo 13



HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM



i had unoptimized 18 and 19 for a while



and some other levels in 11-20



just cuz the ydont matter as much



but i get a lot more 53s now



@icecube5011 the first jump on 16 also hurts you a lot more than you think it does



just do il 1 strat



yea the jump on 16 is bad



52s become regular



HMMMMMMMMMMMMM, i'll compare them to the ILs



getting 53 mostly  boils down to getting like



sub 27.8 1-10



and a good 20



other levels arent as consequential



11: hold right jump 3 times
12: dont hold right entering, grapple immediately, tap up after grappling and hold right + down after
13: fall really far, grapple ceiling, swing
14: dont jump, aim for straight upward trajectory
15: small jump, grapple late for big swing
16: dont jump, let go of grapple as soon as you touch the falling block, jump in preparation for the block falling rather than when it actually falls
17: dont hold down until after you pass the level border on the left
18: either practice grappling asap or dont hold right, small jump before grapple connects
19: same as 15



only things that need to be said about 11-19 optimization really



yea pretty much



too much for me to read



i didnt know speedrunners knew how to read 🤔



yea idk how to read



using my voice for this to type it out



and using a text to speach



yeah, i just go crazy smashing my keyboard and somehow we have conversations

can't wait to send this to you everytime you fail a wall kick on stream



also wall kicks will work



22 skip. Probably the most advanced strat used by top tier runners of Give Up, Robot. This frame-perfect trick can be utilized in one level, though only one situation is considered worth the risk. The most commonly attempted levels are 22, 22, and 22. Less common levels you'll see are 



beautiful



Yo Towny, gotta say, this video quality and editing are on top



Great work man



Thank you lycro 🙂



Nice script and execution

writing out every level that can use wallkicks really puts into perspectice how fucking dumb they are

im delirious



guys



how do you not fail at 45



how do you not lose a sub 4 pace to 45



Jeez, died to 45 again?
You and 45 got a real problem



ye 45 is pretty L



Just take it easy
Don't be to stressed
Better taking a second longer to complete it then to die and lose 20



And practice the hell ouut of it in the trainer



ok fair

Welcome



> 21



what



well prolly a 24



is it just



1 hsg 5 wk 6 wk



1 hsg and the wks
1hsg saved so much though



exactly



this isn't rta right?



YOOOOOOooo grats on the PB again Towny!



yes it is
The new 1 saves like 1 seconds or something



two over doing 1 normally



yeah



Wait



really fucking hard though



THIS IS RTA?



yea



I don't believe you



NOWAY



lycro you saw 1 hsg right



Yep



But holy



What's this time



Noway



still no 8 ihook omegalul



I mean
Its almost 22 in the beggining of 10
and 22 + 3 = 25
It has been done withut hsg



Oh no I'm sorry



I'm stoopid



well add 1 hsg to the list of sub 3 strats i guess



yo guys, I just noticed Towny added the 22 skip (one of the fundamental strats that make up a modern Give Up Robot Speedrun) and the wallkick videos to the Guides section in SRC



and this got me thinking



what about these "guides?" they are kinda outdated and one of htem isnt even halfway done

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



4:28, not bad bro!



LETS GO DIG!



Nice, congratulations on the sub 4:30



all arcanod strats



finally got an acceptable pb



ARCAN :omegalul:  D



yoooo congrats on the pb



egypnod



well i might've died on 38 twice



and 34 once



sick pb dig!



still an amazing time



ty



sub 4:10 next



then sub 4



nice



will get sub 4:10 using arcanod strats first



what strats to u plan to learn



then i will use a few strats to sub 4



well i already have them learnt



oh



but i will start implementing



22, 24 and 43



after sub 4:10



as u add in strats runs get riskier and riskier



indeed



u rly gotta practice them strats



man, you're already good, you should start using the strats now, so you get used to the,



do not delay the strats like I did with fast50



idk man i wanna get a decent time first



ig ill use 22 and 24



its gonna be hard to get a sub 4 but eventually it will just happen



yeah, but you'll get one if you use good strats too!



ur gonna be a sub 4 if u keep getting better at the same pace u are now



yea this is around like



if you do some strats you'll get sub4 in no time



still my first week actaully running



dude



talent



probably my 3rd day even



actually running game



yep, that just shows you can get it if you do the big strats KEKEKEKEKE



has it only been 3 days?



it's been a few weeks



but i've been inactive mostly



so yeah 3 days of actual running



wow



1st day i went from a 24 to a 4:57



then 2nd day nothing



3rd day 4:28



it took me a full month of school to get a sub 6



lol



break time, every day, the grind continued



plan is to bop doggo and klice before my matches



so i have a chance at beating klice



good idea- wait that means u might bop me



maybe



u wanna bop hetheis first



start small but the victory is stilll juicy



not hard



i can probably do it if i start implementing today



yh u wanna bop him first



but i just got pb, lemme upload and submit



k



and i didnt get even get a sub 1 1-20



cuz of a death



pretty weirdchamp



well a pb is pretty pogchamp



be proud of the fact u got a pb



ok



its great tho that ur finding room for improvement



good title

free indeed



did u schedule with firewarp?



he doesnt accept dms from people in this server



i sent him a fr like two days ago and its still pending



damn



just ping him in #tournament :KEKW:



ive gotten lycrod 3 times across two runs



what would be lycrod mean



the prophecy



dying at the end of 44



the lycro prophecy



oh no



go slow



it saves time



my strat to be consistent at it is release a little late



cuz then you go upwards and have a lower chance of misssing it

L



quite



22 skip is one of the fundamental strats that make up a modern Give Up, Robot speedrun. On average this trick will save you about 3 seconds over the old method, shown here. Now, the new method. So, the main goal is to slide between these two spinners. It's a pixel perfect gap, so it needs to be lined up using this block. Let's start with the fundamentals. There are 4 blocks that make up this platform, each will fall independently when touched. The procedure in this trick is to jump over the firs



you want to jump on these two blocks, allowing robot to slip through the tiny crack

awful 41-50



but thats a uh



33 second pb?



not that my pb was anywhere close to  being hard to beat



nice getting bopped everywhere



ill run again later today



gg



had a death to 50  last pillars



YOOOOOOOOO



wait you do fast 50?



HOW MANY PBS IN A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME



GRATS PANSEAR!



im awful at both normal and fast 50



so might as well do fast lol



i have no idea how to do fast 50



i cant even get past the first bunch of pillars



how to do fast 50:
- grind it for like three straight hours
- get it probably twice in that amount of time
- yolo it in a run that can pb with 50 skip and cant without it
- repeat until pb



most accurate guide I've ever seen



8 seconds of timeloss on 50
5 on 48  
uhh



and more  timeloss



wouldve been better if i was recording  ((joke))

what is true ending



there literally arent any other endings



except for hard



when you beat lvl 52



accurate



its needed to do an hwk in every lvl



it is just 1 hsg but repeated 10 times



wait i  really cropped my run wrong



i reset like  5 runs before starting the actual run



:6head:



she puts wrong category names on all of her gur pbs



i think it started because she put any% on one without realizing that it didnt make any sense



and then the next one was   random seed glitchless



mm i love when my gur is randomized



i think i put  set seed actually



but still



did i have an   all collectibles run ?



next is no major skips



i did not have an  all collectibles run



literally just passed the 50hsg with the perfect speed



if i had went 1 pixel slower i would've died



yeah tahts  usually the case



i dont think you can die from 50 hsg



you can



you can



i have died to it



on pb pace runs



cyclowns lost a wr to it once



o



might stream gur pb attempts



merpell lost a race due to dying twice in a row to it



just did wakeless 22 lol



oh yeah i should put that on the bingo



the only 22 challenge on the bingo is to die by crushing



22 without pressing right is  good



ok im gonna stream attempts



im certain i can pb

rest in peace motivation

yeah its possible



i've gotten it without the line up



pixel perfect tho



and not fast at all lol



That's the old method that was used before we discovered the easy setup



oh god that mustve been pain



it only lasted like two weeks



but yeah



its slower actually



ye



thats why i said not fast



not fast == slow



ah usually when people say a strat isnt fast they mean its barely faster than not doing the strat



afaik at least



A trick developed by a brazillian btw (not me tho :PepeHands: ) and improved by cyclowns

is that without 23 wk or 24 hsg



or any 29 strat



nothing



only fast 22



the rest is arcanod strats



rip that run to 50 btw



i still need to get a 56  1-20



just gonna put this out there



im not sure if ive gotten a 1:3x   1-30



this was easily sub 4 pace



i meeaan



any 1-20 run is sub 4 pace



unless you really mess it up



bru



it was 1-30



1:44



arcanod strats



arcanod got a 1:42



in the wr



so if its arcanod strats for 31-50 then not exactly sub 4



no i do 1 hsg



actually 2



50 and 43



why those before 24 lol



they all free



i do 24 normally cuz it loses the least time



true



i think 43 glitchless loses less time than 24 if you do it optimally



you saw my 43



yeah 43 hsg is arguably easier than an optimal glitchless 43 anyway



optional glitchless 43 being



jump from start and grab the third block, hold up, release grapple and grab the block above third, land on second block, jump to grapple last block and swing to end

wait i meant



a falling wk



yes



you don't get as much speed tho

that's correct



H5, H8 and H9 has no runs

you guys imagined it so hard that it came true



@Dignity



ok



wait @merpell i used 2.0 for the hard 9



well you linked the 49



soo



either way



yeah but thats the hard 9 i am speaking about rn



yeah the 49 sure i used 3.0



but not hard 9



well you submitted the hard 9 with the 49



resubmit it with the right video



eh idc anyways lel



it was bad anyways



i figured out the trick to making my key cap not fall off



put tape on my grapple finger



impossible



my hands are sweaty and my middle finger was sticking to the grapple key and pulling it off



its weird playing without feeling the key



but at least the key cap doesnt fall off



oh btw



so you're just playing with the switch?



im going for fast 50 now



nah



im taping my finger



ah nvm



so it doesnt stick



misunderstood



tape is considered a tool



so thats a tas



towny uses a controller



ban him from the lb

yoink



bad run



damn gg



stonks nice



i bopped icecube :POGGERS:



:allegedly:



i think im ready



for sub 4



go get it



hype pbs



i can get 12's on 50



and 11's



do i stream attempts?



i might in a bit



rtd why do you go for 34/36 wk



shit is so useless



he gets em tho



34 is slightly useless



36 is very not useless



actually holy shit



i might have 5 hours of free time in a bit



i kinda wanna stream until sub 4 but



ik motivation wont last



as long as i quickly hit 50 im happy



a good fast 36 is like 3.3
a good 36 wk is like 2.8



.5 sec timesave and 36 wk is stupidly inconsistent unless you practice it for way longer than you should



better off getting a .5sec timesave from hail mary 35 which is like 1/5 as hard



tbf it doesnt lose much to miss



no hail mary 35 is harder than 36 wk for me



and it loses more time



36wk doesnt lose that much to a miss but if i only hit it 1 in 30 times without practicing for a crazy amount



then ill just keep my .3 or .4 time save over a fail



yea lmao you shouldn't do any trick if you hit in 1 in 30



fast 1 or 1 hsg might be more worth than 36 wk



yea both of those r way less consistent than 36 for me



fuck it im more consistent at 43 wk than 36 wk



fast 1 is 100% worth



but i guess it is 1



consistent low 4.XXs every run is so good



and if you practice it a bunch you can get it probably around 50% of the time



takes some willpower and bruteforce to learn though



it's a struggle



i think if i hit all the strats im going for deathless



and i get like a decent 53.3 1-20 or something



it can 3:1x



imagine the scenes if cyclowns beats rtd to the 3:1x



or if cyclowns gets a sub rtd 3:20 and sensual comes out of nowhere to steal the 3:1x



imagine the scenes



if i can bop sensual il be happy



which should be totally doable



i kinda wanna have a bounty for first sub 3:20 but 1. im bankrupt and 2, its just free rtd money



i kinda wish i grinded more for first 3:2x



if i hadnt lost a run to the last pixel of 50 after doing 50 hsg i would have first 3:3x

mmmmm a 2:42 died to 45



mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm



m



rip motivation



how are you dying to 45



dumb death



just gotta go slow



after the last thing



hubris



OF ALL THE PEOPLE TO ASK THAT

and be deliberate



KEKW



i went too far low



wearing a blindfold



when going for the 2nd platform at the end of 45



didnt doggo do 45 blind



yep



gur blindfolded was a thing for like 1 day



and we got every level except like 39, 42, and 50



42 and 50



39 is free



oh yea u did 39



i think i did too idr



gur blind sounds fun too bad the game has almost no audio cues



is using a metronome unethical or what



it has music



klice if you go fast enough



i used a metronome to plan out 42



the music might sync to the gampleay



using a metronome is outside help

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/804121631256608848/unknown.png



yeah figured



and you have audio cues



what is a



but you can pick a song you know well thats close the the desired bpm



metronome



thing that keeps steady beat



and hum that to yourself



ok



thats the closest youll get



1 liek = 1 prey dagnotye get soob faur



no liek :YEPsad:



basically all of the levels are short enough that muscle memory and the sound cues of hitting grapples is enough



yeah makes sense



you can grapple for one frame to check if youre against a wall



for a few levels



and for longer levels the music never changes so



time it to music



39 actually syncs super well to the music if you do it right



there is one really annoying part of the song thats one beat off



nvm



i dont like 29 wk



damn



lost a 3:24 to 50 hsg



rip



Sadge



Yo, I was thinking, is it possible to slide off the end in 42?



Like we do on 40?



isnt that what we did for a while



for tas



before wks



Oh, didn't know it



i mighte br wrong



Towny slide was discovered before wks then?



I do not remember which one was discovered first



wks first



I think wks were discovered first



towny slide was after



Yeah



maybe we didnt use hsg on 42



i dont think so



where would you use it



At the end, like a towny slide



But I'm almost sure it's slower



u dont have enough time to set it up



Like



tested



99,9% slower



Oh, dammit



currently trying to tas level 1 with no right inputs

dunno what to do from here



lol thats sick



too bad we can't do the whole run like this, that would be sick



when am i ever wrog



also wow



1 is only so interesting cus youre immediately forced to turn left and face the wall



most other levels are either blatantly impossible or let you stay facing right for the duration of them

gl!



lost this run due to sister interrupting



ah



no its already dead



to 43 and 50



bump



bomp



ok so



was on pb pace into 50



then the weirdest shit happened



i got fast 50 and got to the hsg



then i did the hsg



and i bonked on the block after it



which killed my speed



how tf



like i bonked on the 3 tile block



after doing the hsg



has that happened before?



eitherway im mad i lost another pb to 50



yeah happens very occasionally



im pissed



hi pissed im dad



hi dad im dignity



tbh i kinda wanna see how far i can get with arcanod strats



- 22



and 50 ofc



if i do 22 skip and fast 50 + all other arcanod strats



is that a klice bop



that's not really enough to determine a time



maybe with fast enough movement



fair



either way fuck any hsg or wk out there :)



guess who got a pb of 1 second improvement



um...



Calvin Coolidge?



Mia Khalifa?



After 2 weeks of playing bloons td 6 maistlin sees the sun again



Sasha grey?



Tell us. Who got a pb of 1 second



What if the one who got the 1 second pb is YOU, maistlin?



How can I assure you aren't the one



You can't.



:monkagiga:



Except that I haven't stopped playing BTD6 for the past 2 weeks straight



Some say he's still poppin' to this day



BRO 50 SUCKS

allegedly (3) RicardoVibe (3) slep (3) 


lycro u typing a whole essay



They told me I would never get a recorded pb.
They told me I was a dumbass who always forgot to record my runs, but I wanted to prove them wrong.
I turned my computer on, open OBS, hit Start Recording, and started to play.
Everything was clicking, my will to get something recorded was bigger than their unbelief.
I did both 23 and 32 wks first try.
I did 29 first try.
34 and 36.
I went slow on 44.
I left my hubris intact in 45.
46 and 48 went by.
50 was a masterpiece.
I had done it, a run never seen before.
It was magical.

But then I noticed I recorded the wrong scene



thanks for this

@Daveed im gonna beat ur time today



no



do et



yea



I'm gonna stream it



Can someone explain the scenes system in obs



I wanna improve stream quality



Scenes are just different setups. Like I have a GUR scene that has my cam, game, and livesplit. Then I have my desktop scene which has my desktop and cam. I can switch between those at any time



Ah



from my understanding stream quality = bitrate



u can go to settings --> output to increase/decrease bitrate



I just figured out game capture



I'll just use that for now

Howdy



When did this game kick off last I checked there was no record for like 6 years



It kinda happened last year when this discord was made



Damn I wish I knew. I was only like 5sec off from previous record last time I tried



oh whats your PB?



was that the arcanod days of 4:06?



I don't know for sure. It was a while ago but sub 5:00 for sure



Nice. Well we've discovered a lot of new tricks since then. And yeah the communities definitely popping off. We have like 20 active players on SRC or something



I even knew of the skip in 22 before it was posted



the fabled 22 skip



ooo nice



a fundamental strat indeed



I'll have to check out WR to see if there's anything I can do to help



I'm a bit rusty though



Nice, well if you need any help with anything let us know. The new strats are pretty insane



didnt know 11 skip though

@LycroP2  I'm going to do it for the rest of the game. That screen shot is like 5 years old when I made a 3D version of all the levels for GMod. BUt I needed something to do today so I'm screen shotting the whole game.



Also Way to go copycat



@hetheis  did something like this, he made some levels on minecraft some months ago



But wow man all GUR lvls on Gmod

Imma just use my phone now



So it'd be a low 2:22



Phone ftw



better safe than sorry again



It feels so good when you get a flawless segment

50?



my 20 pb is 56



YOOOOOOOOO



LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOO



Holy shit this looks sick



Is it on that grid pattern? I don't remember the order



Grats on the PB dig! Very close to the sub-4 very soon



yea



lost it to 47 and 50



could've sub 4-ed if not for 47



and I'm happy with my 50



since I got fast 50



yea



not across letters cus im stupid but every letter has grid pattern



Oh, I get it may be hard to do it across all letters



But sadly it won't be on SRC



Or is it?



rtd without fast 1 :KEKW: rtd with fast 1 :POGGERS:



i've been enlightened, fast 1 is the truth



is @Porkburge new?



ye



cool



if me calculations are correct it should be 4am for u



ye



jesus christ wtf are u doing at 4am



trying to fix ur door?



my sleep schedule is always changing



its pretty bad right now



I'm probably going to sleep in an hour or so



here we have an example of a battered sleeping pattern



dont u feel groggy?



my sleep schedules batter me bruh



no I never feel groggy



except for like 5 minutes in the morning



what time do u wake up???



around 10 or 11 am



maybe everyone around ur age has a shit sleeping pattern



Yup a lot of us do I think



your 20's are a very degenerate period



im 13 so i cant say shit but damn



I never really had a good schedule when I was a teenager anyway, so maybe its just me :lul:



the thing is with sleeping patterns is that its so easy to ruin it but so hard to repair it



literally every teen stays up til 3am



no cap



yep



true, I guess things dont change lmao



I used to stay up two days in a row some times



thanks for the heads up, im now gonna make an effort to have a good sleeping pattern in me 20s



just have a good sleeping pattern in general



will pay dividends



eh it's underrated



i thought my sleeping pattern was fucked



11pm sleep



back when I was on adderall I would sleep like 3 hours a week EZ



mine isnt hoooorrible



but i am up at 2am so



all weeker:pogu:



@Towny jeez, still awake??



GO



TO



SLEEP



im playing mario



gotta grind it out bro 💪



yeah, grind out fucking ur sleeping pattern



im glad im not the only nintendo kid here



zelda is the bomb



ah yes, zelda

I was thinking about speedrunning ocarina of time



I like HESSing



i never played the og oot but i beat the remake



i wanna play oot randomizer



not speedrun it cuz fuck that



just seems like it'd be fun



I play randomizers all the time! They're so fun dude



majoras mask is probably the hardest zelda game



celeste randomizer was super fun



Not even close ice



but i havent played it in a bit



Zelda II is the hardest game



hand down, no question



zelda II is the "hardest" zelda game



never played it



It's why it's my favorite zelda game



insane man



how can u understand whats going on



dat 2d shit



I'll do another alcoholic% speedrun on twitch sometime



zelda II kinda blows



unless you know where to go



in which case its okay



yeah it's direction isn't perfect, but it's mechanics are fucking awesome



celeste randomizers are pretty fun, but they get boring after a while



and has the first dark link fight



yea theres only so much randomization it can do



the oot dark link fight is my faveropute part



yeah that was fun in oot



if i wanna fuck around ill just play celeste mods with the seekers in every room variant



zelda skyward sword has the best bosses



u cant change my mind on that



naaaaa



ghirahim is



so ass to fight



i still need to finish my  own celeste map



i still like ghirahim tho



i barely touched it in like 8 months



this was the best zelda boss ever

from what i remember

i dont hate skyward sword as much as most people



i love it



by that i mean i like skyward sword



the motion controls are annoying tho



ngl oot bosses are ovverated



i honestly dont remember any zelda bosses as being super fun



i like da bird

id say the best boss was bongo bongo



i like the funny drum man



is that from twilight princess



wind waker



oh



i havent played windwaker /:



i plan to tho



E M U L A T O R



its my favorite zelda



maybe besides botw



one of the only games where the remaster makes basically nothing but improvements



imo



botw is the best by far



botw is like generational masterpiece good so not much contest



hyrule warriors age of calamity is dog shit



its so boring



only zelda game ive played is uhhhh   phantom hourglass



thats the sequal to windwaker right?



i liked phantom hourglass



i never finished it though



since i stole my sisters copy



when i played it i was too young



i had it on a  ds r4



i had a r4



but something went wrong somewhere  so i could never save my game



full of pirated games



and i just played the start multiple times



lol



i should homebrew my old 3ds



or maybe not



isnt that a way to get free games



aint it used to install fbi



so u can search ur 3ds files



not exclusively but i'd probably just use it to get roms of random games running



all i know is that its a nightmare to install



its not the easiest thing in the world

it's a movie



a very good movie



u should watch it



will do



TOWNY GO THE FUCK TO SLEEP UR MAKING ME TIRED



Ya its a classic. One of my favorite tarantino films



pulp fiction is a movie about telling bedtime stories to oranges

KEKW 


and ice, what do you mean you dont go to sleep 5:30am to wake 12pm? :KEKW:



the reason I said that is because the narrator in that video is a lead role in pulp fiction



IM GOOD MY MOMMY SAYS I SHOULD SLEEP EARLY

if you dont let her know...



KEKEKEEKEK



bad influence



when I was in vacation I'd go to bed like 1:30am but only sleep like 6am



now that my classes are back I go to sleep like 2:30 am and wake up 6:50



wow u guys are a good influence



go to sleep early



oh boy we are :KEKW:



i will not follow this advice



We just told a 13 year old to watch pulp fiction. We are angels



but you should



B)



what is it for adults



Do what I say, not what I do



yeah its very graphic



make sure your mum doesn't find out



pulp fiction is like



very R rated



wow i love u guys



:peepoLove:



i hate to admit that my tale about it being about oranges was



a lie



if u dident tell me then i would have asked my dad if i could watch it



I thought you were referencing reservoir dogs



Why would you ask your dad to watch something



cause hes like



13



i did that at 13



yeah, but I dont think thats necessary



sometimes. other times i would just pirate it



at least I didn't do that



like



fianally someone that had a childhood



were none of you 13 years old at any point



ikk



when we went to the cinema, he wouldn't let me watch some movies



like when Deadpool came out I think I was 12 not sure, but he went and didnt bring me



me dads rly annoying when it comes to 18s



ive never watched one in me life



Yeah, but if you're going to do something you shouldn't, the second thing you shouldn't do is let your parents know lol



but when was about watching shit on netflix I just watch it lol



if its internet realated me dad will find out



I was 13, very sheltered. I learned how to use the piratebay like everyone else cyclowns



i was actually very not sheltered



i just asked my parents anyway and they were like 'we dont care'



cant pirating result in jail



BASED PARENTS :pogu:



BASED



not a chance



no lol



you go to jail for pirating if you're working for a company



worst that will happen is your ISP will cut you off



MS does not like schools/corporation/etc that pirate windows



bro anti piracy screens are scary asf



Pirating is bad for the ones who post the content online



ik theyre fake but



but theres not much you can do about random fuckers using hwidgen



but for who downloads it nah



But I don't think a movie from the 90's is going to have production companies camping torrents for IP addresses



oh you pirated citizen kane? prepare for the firing squad

{Reactions}
KEKW (2) 


It is on netflix if you have it



u guys are lucky ur parents allowed u to do shit



Mine didn't, I just did it behind their backs



it gave me a very interesting life



idk if im LUCKY



They gave up when I was like... 16



trust me my parents would find out



my mother is very concerned about who I talk with, but not what I watch



its probably a net positive



since i started programming at like 13



and now i have an actual decent skill



if im ever on my phone me parents assume im on the hub



dont go on the hub kids



I actually had to think about what that meant for a second

{Reactions}

I remember when I was like 9 and my cousin (12) at the time told me to not search for RedTube in the web



I just did not search it lol



m8 i got meatspinned



everyones been meatspinned



someone told me to google it



or meatspun



being a 12 year old with free reign to download whatever the fuck i wanted or go on whatever forums made me age like 5 years



with how much shit i saw



Same^



https://12yearoldsimulator.com/



Being on 4chan at age 15 was probably not the best for my development



I remember when I discovered inconigto mode



fuck4chan



I still lurk some boards on there



ur parents still could have checked the router



why would they

"to protect me"



eh its reasonable



to have some oversight over ur kids shit



i almost certainly should not have been allowed to go some places



but once you hit like 15 or 16 just let the kid do9 whatever because they'll figure out how to anyway



apparently 11 yr olds use the hub



my mom used to be like: what are you watching there? but everytime It was either CS, SM64, or Rocket League than she was like: watching video game videos again? jeez



lol i remember my dad was like 'whatcha watching'

MY DAD SAID THE SAME KEKW



I hope he's doing ok



im glad i didnt start using discord until i was like  16



i am so glad discord didnt exist until i was like 15



ROFL



ive seen people a lot younger than that  talk about a lot of stuff they shouldnt on here



In the ancient times of my youth, we used skype



ahem copycat



yea its a lot harder to moderate



nsfw shit



when its not centralized



rule 34



so u just end up with 8 year olds in the hentai channel bein like



wtf is going on here



my dad would be like: why are you watching instead of playing?
And inside I was like
cuz mom doesnt let me play unless its weekends dumbass



and then irreprable brain damage



I'm not letting my kid touch a computer until he's 40. I've seen enough on here



hehe boey



tbf me mums more understanding then me dad when itcomes to this stuff



can say the opposite



agreed.



i will not even let my child know of the existence of technology beyond the mortar and pestle



and then i will release them into the world and watch them spontaneously combust

how



i know literally nothing about the man



the man is cool



he makes nintendo vids



would recommend watching it



in this memes case nuttendo

LELW 


He's very... informational



he seems just like a



newer PBG



or projared



or smth



Pretty much actually



penut butter gamer



hopefully not a newer projared



Yeah we really don't need another one of those



why were there like 500 of those same exact  channel



in fact, any video game reviewer after AVGN can probably just stop tomorrow



white dude with short brown hair makes top 10 lists about nintendo games in his apartment

{Reactions}
LEL 


no



he doesnt do lists



its not like ceave gaming lol



it's something



nathial bandy is gud



nah, scott has its own charm



his chaos is very distinct



the first video of him I watched was about memory cards



would recommend



honestly this game community has the weirdest people

{Reactions}
peepoLove (2) 


i love it



There are some good scott episodes, but you'd have to find the subject matter interesting



I like the E3 history ones



yep



apparently nintendo directs are gonna stop



2020 was a shit yr for nuttendo



did nintendo release like anything in 2020



all stars



oh yeah



yeah some cease and desists



and thats abouit it



a couple deathsquads sent to pokemon fangame creators



just indies



no big



acnh was also 2020 right



OH shit acnh



oh yeah



yeah thats what i was forgetting



They basically stole their Intellectual property, they sort of deserve to be hung from the neck tbf



ngl ac is kinda boring for me



me sister likes it tho



acnh?



I'm with you



literally stealing the food from shigeru miyamoto's mouth like a mother taking food away from its newborn



animal crossing



ohhhh



I'm more of a harvest moon 64 kind of guy



I was like



i have acnh but it just didnt capture me that much



new leaf was better



wtf a new Assassins creed?



my gf is a huge animal crossing nerd and she likes new leaf a lot better



so idk



but animal crossing makes more sense if talking about nintendo KEKW



assassins creed: animal crossing



dont hate but i never found among us fun



so boring



i have never played or watched a single game of among us



not out of principle i just never bothered



u dident miss out



Among us is fun if you're playing with your own friends that you can VOIP with



assassins creed have been the same shit since ac black flag



and ac odyssey is crtl c ctrl v of ac origins



ac is just a yearly cashgrab franchise



no surprise



among us is fun if its with friends



for a while



ive never played assasins creed



yea i cant imagine playing among us public lobbies

{Reactions}
cheesed 


imo ac black flag is the best of the franchise



oooo i can



i really like black flag



im gonna try out dark souls



and have



its a fucking shit show



YOU WERE FOLLOWING ME



YOU MUST BE THE IMPOSTOR



if you play dark souls start with dark souls 3



and then I was like no lol



probably the most accesssible



and easiest to find and play



ok



also im biased cuz its my favorite one



I've played ds2, and they say its the worst



but I liked it a lot



ok people say dark souls 2 is the worst soulsborne game



so I think I'll like any dark souls



but thats only because all of the other ones are masterpieces



they are all cool by the look of it



I got to play them



dark souls 1, 3, bloodborne, sekiro, are all 10/10



and dark souls 2 is like 8.5/10



so its the worst



rn I'm focusing in finishing DOOM eternal and quake



DAAAMN BOE



i really liked dark suls 2



i need to finish my current playthrough of it



also still need to finish sekiro



is bloodbourne part of dark souls?



sorta



same company, same game design more or less
but different setting/story



like a sequal to the trilogy



guys, I've never played dark souls



a generic question right here: who's glad that didn't buy cyperpunk2077?



im not allowed



shortening cyberpunk feels so wrong



cp2077



i didnt buy 2077



looks like you're commiting a horrible crime but in the future



i was very skeptical



and it paid off i guess



tbh



ive never played gta either



you should at some point



they're all good



i dont have anything that could run 2077 so i waswnt planning on buying it anyway



also that



i have like a 1050



How would I go about doing that the best way? I heard the remasters are fucking ass and that's all that's on steam



I was like, man, I've done this with watch dogs 2
I had like wd1 a lot even tho the game had some flaws, it was pretty solid
then I bought wd2 in launch



I mwan not bad



i got me pc recently so it has a 1160 super



but the generic ubisoft open world game



dks1 remaster isnt that bad



def not worth buying in launch



i think the multiplayer/port experience was bad at first but its better now



Guess I could buy the og disk, but I don't even have an optical drive lol



dark souls 2 scholar of the first sin is on steam and its great



apparently rx gpus are actually good



dark souls 3 is on steam and is fine



and by fine i mean one of my favorite games of all time



one of my fgaveroute games is geometry dash



its not just jumping over spikes



its this shit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLSAnjoN70k&lc=z230czaynw3uetsxc04t1aokgnexiv2lhrpwex5k2lr2rk0h00410

id probably enjoy it



i really like rhythm games but its not like a huge focus on the rhythm part



can cause headaches tho



but i rly like dubstep type music and flashing lights so the game is perfect for me

in this 110 degree concrete hell

I dont have many hours in one game cuz I vary a lot



cos ive seen memes saying u can do that



i havent but my gf has



more or less done that



my game with most your is Rocket League, with 340 hours I think



my longest time is 600 hours on botw



is anyone gonna get he new fnaf game?



i haventg played a fnaf game in ages



theres still new ones coming out



is this like FNAF 593



lol



the creator said he was done at fnaf 4



well that was a lie



i just googled it theres 12 games



imo, the best game is still fnaf1



fnaf1 is the only one i know shit about



all the other ones have perfect strategies



that nver fail



my friends used to talk about all day in 5º grade lol



i was in year 1 when it came out lol



ahem fnaf 2



fnaf 4 was way too easy



fnaf 3 dident have an optimal stratergy



it does have one



too



does it?



anotha one



yep



all of them have



i never understood fnaf 3



the only exception



sister location was rly good



is fnaf 6



fnaf 6 dident have a optimal strat



yeah, but it wasnt the original fnaf gameplay



.



yh



the science behind fnaf is the sense of hoplessness



idk how to spell exception



exeption



i thinl



i cant spell



just googled



exception



E E N G L I S



yay i was right



HMMMMMMM



UEHEUHEUE jk



xcexpceition



wow



how did he know



yo did my first quake IL run



as the pussy I am I chose to run the first boss of the game



58 secs yaaay



quake runs are really cool



im gonna start speedrunning luigis mansion soon



yoooooo I got to play luigi's mansion yet



probably my favorite gc game



lm3 sucks



what about sunshine and melee***



ive never played brawl



strong opinions in the chat EKEKEKEK



ofc ive played melee



the most overrated game ever



I wrote brawl in aciddent srry, was talking bout melee



why do u think that



just ovverated



its a good game but defo not better than ultimate



the only complaint I see people having with ultimate is the netcode



can someone gimmie a link to townys rge sounds



im gonna make a mix with em



o wait



tis not mp3



sad



this looks better i think

WOOWWWWWWWW



THATS COOL AF



even tho I prefer the other one



I just wasted 10 minutes of my life scrolling through the 400 messages since midnight



KEKW



maybe just the com can be lava



then the rest rainbow blocks



can someone get townys rage sounds as an mp3?



i wanna make a mix with em



ngl the mix would slap



lost a pb to 50 hsg



was only gonna be by like a second



but still unfort



that run was kinda crazy though



i was +1 into 43



then golded 43 and 44



and saved a second on 45



ah I see, did you go slow on 44



how many gd players exist in this server



I have 54 demons



pansear is former gd player



i am also



a



I was on big break



came back recently



warming back up with an insane demon



i can (not proudly) say that I have 2000+ hours on gd



i have 1k on steam and an  unknown amount on mobile



that sounds reasonable



adds up to 1.3k mayb e



for 50 demons



I don't really like beating free demons



the only demons I allow myself to beat are hard and insane demons only



ofc there are extremes but fuck off



i spent more time.making layouts i think



o a creator



the times i do olay the game again  are to mess around in the editor



imo I don't have nearly enough creativity to make levels



so I just beat levels



i cant decorate anything



just make levels that are somwhat fun to play



I'm hosting a collab rn with every sm63 gd player and it's going pretty pog



even if our decorator is lazy AF :peepoBlanket:



this is the most recent thing i made  which was like  over half a year ago at this point probably

cus i got a random bonkless 49



gud moring  everybody



gm copy



isnt bonkless 49 frame perfect?



or atleast a few frame trick



i dont know how precise it is exactly but if youre aiming for a low bonk then youll get it eventually



i got it yesterday too actually but i didnt have splits open



i mean i should know since i tied the 49 wr lol



i should try and retie the wr on 2.0 tbh



but i cant be bothered reinstalling



4.0 should be eligible for ils once its done



i gave sensual the idea to make tas robot red



which means that having tas wont make it ineligible



any tips on not going too slow on 50 hsg?



since i get all the speedy pillars and shit then i either miss the hsg or i go wayy too slow



wdym too slow



like the setup?



or the speed from the hsg



i dont make it



the speed



after i launch it mostly doesnt give me the speed i need



i think that means youre releasing slightly too late



yea got it



you know whats worse than 1 jail?



50 jail



arguable



first of all 50 jail doesnt exist unless youre doing ils or something



its like



the point of 1 jail is that youre stuck in 1



bc its the start of the run



you get to 50 on pb pace every run



and then you cant get past 50



at least you get to play the rest of the game in that case



fair



runs time



hoping to sub 4



ok nvm i got lost watching mini run smb1



lul



i hate 1 jail so much wtf



whatd i say



YA LOVE TO SEE IT

Grats on bopping me!



GGs!



dont you have a 3:3x lycro?



No lol



3:43



o



Almost got a 3:33 these days but lost it to 49



daveed also has a 3:43



i forget whose is better



i think lycros



yea



i want motivation



daveeds is 3:43 by one frame lol



Or just write some shit in paint like I do



im too lazy to make my own thumbails



Sub4



i did it  once i think



Look at mines



There's no laziest shit than that



i make ok thumbnails ig



costs more effort than choosing one of the 3 default thumbnail suggestions



hmmmhmhmm



wanna see one of my thumbnails?



here's one for my smb1 tas

normally it gives the end screen as an option for celeste videos  but not this time



you just took an image off google images right



no i think i took a screenshot of the game



cant argue with that

celeste kinda fun tbh



i ran it once and never tried it again



but i wanna get back into it



a fresh breath of air might help



ill consider getting back into celeste



Run quake



Quake is cool af



what is quake



Noway



It's from the same creators of Doom



It's doom, but with some different mechanics and In 3D



It has a lot of bhop mechanics and insane good designs



Its from 97 but I'm playing it and it's so fun



I did a run of the first boss and finished it in 23 seconds



celeste is goood



ok so celeste or quake



celeste for speedrunning is hard



its easy to get an ok time



but hard to get anything better than that



hard games fun tho



i remember mirror temple sucked tho



low skill floor high skill ceiling



which is ideal



ive tried improving this time  but i can never get it any faster than like  .1 every time i try ((example))

jumpyluff 👀



jumpyluff



oh



He's everywhere got damn



Yeah jumpyluff ran some celeste ILs



Yeah jumpyluff ran some every run that exists



true!



also since when does gur have segment leaderboards?



uh like last month



???ok



i never noticed before



But thats cool i think



yeah theres no real reason to look at the spot where they are if you dont know theyre there



only other category is garbage kek



but how would you time anything other than 1-10



time of split - time of the split before it



theres gonna be a split selecter in 4.0



so that its not tedious to run anything other than 1-10



ooo



really, the one you want to, if you want to play celeste, go and play it! celeste is also good af



@Doggo why'd you take down your pb vid?



vegas shat itself



was literally just 5 and a half minutes of black screen



KEKW



fixed



vid isnt done uploading though



rtd lost 1x to 48



not surprising



thats the third time

I got 4m 20s and was so mad coz I only needed 3 seconds to get 16th



yooo grats on all the pbs!



and holy shit rtd 20.xx again



you'll get it very very soon



I just rewatched the tas after getting a decent time and I was even more surprised tbh



that fucking fast 50 :allegedly:



you should see the 50 il



yep its insane



:YEP:



ok lemme see



WHA



WHA ZE FAK



KEEKEKEKKEEK



:weirdchamp:



that 50 is cring



yo dig get 50 il so you get the ILWR holder role :pogu:



but I already have an ILWR



11:pogu:



beat my level 5 IL



not sure if its optimised



no it's 49 but ok

{Reactions}
pogu 


forty nine



the current 5 IL is the first time i got the trick



and i think  im the only one that did the trick



i just tried to beat it  and tied it twice



I'm taking a look at red ball leaderboards



and like half of the run descriptions say like



"I'll get xx time and then stop playing this game"



that inconsistency must drive them insane



rtd your wr has some tas shit on 50 wtf



2 swing :)



I do 2swing, 2swing ftw



I don't



because I don't like the idea of resetting even more on 50



it's ok not like you ever get to 50 anyway



:KEKW:



not that i ever do either :YEPsad:



man fuck 50 tbh



was on pb pace on no resets



well I do but it's only after dying to 46, 47, or 48 at least 20 times before



into 50



ended up with a 5:01



yep



4:47 no reset



is it possible to watch two discord streams at once ?



some pretty massive chokes



yes



button called 'watch multiple streams'



its an eye with a + sign next to it

4:33 no reset

celeste good



what is celeste?]



one of the best 2d platformers ever made



made by the same person that made GUR



celeste good



I dont know what celseste is

i got my memory back from speedrunning celeste



and remembered



how trash celestial resort was



yep



i dont remember what my time was for the run



it was like 1:0x?



i need to learn the rest of any%



i used to complain about resort until i actually  practised it



i learned forsaken city and old site and then got sidetracked by life



oh yeah i saw you on the city IL leaderboard



i think we're like   8 places apart



neat



i have a sub 1 on city



not sure what the time was exactly



but it was sub 1

huh



i remember sub 1 wasnt even hard



it is  very hard



it seems quite hard



i could probably get it by spending way too much time grinding forsaken city for no reason



or i could just learn the rest of the game



unless im a hidden god at celeste



it isnt that hard



sub 1 is top 50 in IL



and if you can get top 50 in IL you can probably get top 50 in any%



ig im a hidden god then :POGGERS:



i think i have a  1:08 that i forgot to submit



most of my time loss is from just  waiting



im using sub 1 strats  im just not doing them fast enough



i might go and get sub 1 again



ive done any% runs but its just like me thinking about what to do and not following strats



and just not dying



and i think it was like 50 minutes



now i wanna learn any% again



my fastes any% was a 39



i mean if you consider my 'runs' actually runs and not me blind playing through the game



then my time sucks



also you  cannot get sub 1 without spending a lot of time learning strats



i technically speedran all red berries and all chapters but its jsut me fucking around because i like the game



ive ran a few c sides



less to learn



i can try to get sub 1 again but idk



but generally harder to do



c sides seem boring to 'run'



ill go try



just ends up being like resetting because you lost a couple frames in one area



doesnt seem like itd be that hard to submit something for like 4c or 7c though



isnt that kinda also gur



yeah 4c is easy to get a good time



resetting cuz you lost a coupe frames on 1



7c has a lot of dumb strats



allegedly



7c probably has stupid ass demos



that i wuld not go for



and you lose a few seconds at the end of 7c  because going fast in nearly flat ground is hard to do optimally



eh theres more lenience



and it pretty much only applies to level 1



gur isnt optimized enough cuz its not quiite short enough



and not quite easy enough

thats a crazy tie



i think i lose   a few minutes in any% to reflection and summit



becuase i dont really practice them



i actually



despise reflection



sort of



so its just  improvising strats every time



summit a gold was easier than reflection a gold



i dont know why



badline fight fucks me up



i consistently get 12 minute summits in runs



which is  Not good



ok i kinda forgot how to move in general in celeste



reflection gold is annoying



result of not playing for a year ig lol



becuase you spend 5 minutes every time  to the easy part



yea



and then you die to badeline



so i got bored during attempts



i ahd to learn speedrun strats for the badeline fight so that it would be consistent



i think on the run i got the golden  i was just  fucking around and got the heart, cassette and went to the easter egg room



i need to run 2b again actually



that was fun



welp my first city run in like a year and it's 1:48



I forgot all strats and everything too



yea i imagine i've forgotten most of it if i try to run it again



should relearn if I actually wanna get sub 1 again lol



ill aim for sub 1:30 then actually learn strats lol



just learn strats off the bat



its a short enough level



i got a decent 2b time before  without any of the big skips



this trick is so stupid

no doggo 27 in the 1x :peepoSad:



wonder why it only goes up to 480p when my other vids reach 720p



oh yeah thats weird



yt slander



yt couldnt handle the 1x hype in hd



0x will probably happen but its gonna take at least another year



the only clear mistakes in the run are 40 (+0.5) 45 (+1.5) and 48 (+0.5?)



yea well the way i see it



0x is gonna be really difficult because the record is now relatively optimal with current strats



even before wallkicks and stuff were found the record wasn't optimal with strats at the time



And this run is beautiful, no major mistakes



yeah thats why its gonna take so long compared to every other 10 second barrier since cyclowns' wr



Again, congrats on it rtd!



0x would need 1 hsg, 29 underswing, hm35, extra wallkicks in levels like 4 5 21, maybe some extremely lite version of elevator skip will be found



and even then the run would have to be near perfect



if not literally perfect



1 hsg? am I not uptaded?

Oh right, forgot about it



To get a 0x just do 45 skip smh



consistency at swinghops might be a requirement for a feasible 0x



16 would save one second, 20 would save two seconds, if you can get 45 swinghop 0x is free lol



Free



even if you die to the hsg like six times itll still probably save significant time



ok thats a stretch



like four times



if swinghops ever become not a meme i genuinely think elevator skip could become viable



its certainly easier than the wallclimb



and thats been done



albeit not fast



16 saves like 1.5 seconds right



closer to 2 probably



depends on how much the time of landing the swinghop would fluctuate



but the old 16 tas was still way faster than most people will realistically do 16 in a run



and swinghop saved 1.7 over that



i guess 50 IL could be labbed



according to sensual fast last pillars isnt absurdly hard



but its the end of the run



yea i've only done it once



skipping the 2nd pillar doesn't seem too bad but it kinda seems like rng rn



the last three aren't that bad



it's lining up with the hsg that's silly



after the swing



yeah i can get thru the last 3 pillars one swing but not be able to line up for the hsg



i still don't understand how sensual got the hsg in his IL



cause he goes past the second pillar



and somehow comes back and gets stuck



why no dig35 tho



dig35 best strat



@SensualPudding i wanted to ask how you made the custom maps importable ingame since i wanna do that with another flash game that people make maps of



Wait is dig35 like the one in my pb?



I did it by accident but I think it is



I Just made it so you can add assets to the game, can send you the source if I can find it



its not a strat



I know, but idk which one he's talking about



I just wanna be sure



no it literally is not something you can do



Oh lmao, k then



it refers to 35 hsg



dignity invented 45 hsg



everyone knows that



ik, i thought it was forcing that the thing that grappling at the top right of the level and finishing was as HSG



Even tho it isn't



hsg is a medical thing sir



its where they investigate where u piss if u have problems



that remembered when we deicded to search hsg on yt

*do not* search hsg on yt



Why



I’m going to do it



search it and discover it yourself

but youre going to be using a keyboard a lot  soooo its fine i guess

you can also use a program like autohotkey to map other keys to your arrow keys

well looks like emu is banned for the vast majority of runs



so glhf



The GameCube community doesn't seem to like emulators, you can see that the the SMS community accepts runs with NO VIDEO if not below 1:25 hour but it doesn't accept any emulator run below 1:35 hours

the 67 is because he was born in 67

Oh



ngl pansear is legit the first female speedrunner i've seen



all the other ones are trans



no offense to them ofc



Idk why why girls that play games are classed as "gamer girls"



Idk if it buggs anyone else but it buggs me



Games are a really male dominated scene, so women get that kind of treatment unfortunately



I know a few female speedrunners



Can't think of any huge names though

im getting so fucking mad



gamer moment



i got a 4:00.350



and it would have been the first sub 4 (besides maistlin) had i gotten it



so it can always be worse



im not enjoying gur but i really wanna get itttttttttttt



then rtd beat it two days later to flex



if ur trying to force your way into it it probably wont happen



gotta be in the right mind



im gonna do 1 more run



just do 1 hr of attempts everyday u'll get it in no time



rip



That what I did for 16th place



run died



A lot of rage will come with it tho



i do like



silly kids running for 16th place



4 hrs of attempts a week



back in my day there was no 16th place



something like that



im running for top 10 tbh



Old man



Focus on tiny improvements, try to grind down your IL averages, and getting the sub 4 will be easy



i can sub 4



u just need



da consistency



the reason i choked sub 4 in my 4:01 was the dumbest thing ever



i died at 44 in an unimaginable way



oh and ofc a 47 death



all i need to do is not go into dumbass mode in 44 and boom sub 4



oh and ofc naturally missing 50 hsg



50 hsg killed countless sub 4s so not surprised



u dont even need fast 50 to sub 4



let alone 50 hsg



i kinda need it since i dont do any HSGs and i only do 32wk



im gonna continue fast 50 but probs not 50hsg

first run of the day was sub 4 pace into 50



then rip



22 glitch is one of the fundamental glitches that make up a modern give up robot glitch



FOR FUCKS SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE



lost another one



go on then



im dieing inside



to 50



ill dm



Dig, in these hard times, the only thing I can say to you is



Do not stop the grind.



It'll be worth it



yes i agree with the lycrolosophy as usual



I haven't changed much since I got the sub-4 you can see



yep



another one dead to 50



:)



AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH



this time it was 3:39 into 50



:pogu:



Dig sub4 is just a time question



im getting angryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy



Maboe, I took like 4 months to get a sub4 :KEKW: If I did it I'm more than sure you can



And in like 1/4 of the time I did



what



it took me a week to 4:01



actually



5 days



of gur playing



I'm my 3:57 I say it in the description: 
I'm the first brazilian to get a sub4 and one of the first 10 in the world to do it (even tho I'm bad lol)



I only play twice a week when I'm not in vacation



So that kinda explains why I took so long, but still a big part of it was just my shitty mentality



i mean



You can see here I go crazy when I got it kek



the reason i didnt get sub 4 yet is mainly 50 but



its also beacuse i kinda dont go for any hsg ever



except for 50



I'd say most of it was my mentality



50 hsg is the only hsg i do



and 32wk is the only wall kick i do



If you did 24hsg you would've got a sub4 smh



up arrow



24 hsg extremely free



id rather have fun



:KEKW:



24 HSG is free



Ez



24 skip ez



i can get it but what i dont want is getting stuck in 24 jail



I can totally understand someone not wanting to do 43 or 46



24 is NOT hard



Cuz they're late in the run and all shit



But 24



i fail it like  once every 20 times At Most



I get stuck in 46 skip jail ALL THE TIME



24 is free



cant blame me for wanting to smoothly get to 50 every run past 1-20



please just   open gurtrainer and try 24 hsg



i can get it



if your heaving trouble  ask for help becuase it is Not Hard



The sooner you implement a strat the sooner you'll stop to hate it



I wish so fucking much I started doing 50fast earlier



it is free time save



ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fine



YAHOOOOOOOOOO



now the sub 4 is gonna be free tbh



It always has been.



i usually get to 50 in under 3:45



as long as i dont mess up entirely and get a decent 50 time i'll get sub 4 ezz



What's your average 50 time



uh



14s?



it alternates



Then you'll get it very soon believe me



not even sub8 smh



i sometimes pop off and get 11s and 10s



but sometimes im trash and i get 17s and 18s



uhh



maybe sub 4 stream in an hour



lets hope i dont choke



(mic maybe)



So go there, open the game and grind the shit out of it.
If I did it you're more than able to do it.
Just remember.
Do not.
Stop.
The grind.



bro



midyear break is in 2 days



i have even more time now



3 weeks of nothing



if sub 4 doesnt happen then tbh then i can get banned lmao



:pogu:



anyways can dignity surpass 1 viewer and get 2 viewers on stream?!?!?!?



dignity mute until sub4



If you stream rn I'll be there after I take my shower



uh im streaming in an hour



late for all the states guys and shit



@Administrator put this on your to-do-list



:KEKW:



lmao



I'll be there Dig!



omegalul



And I'll be the first to spam YOOOOOOOOOO



I just watched some rtd segments runs and man I want to play GUR but I'll only be able to do it Saturday :PepeHands:



wait y not



why can you only play on saturday



Cuz my mom only let me play on the weekend



I played a lot in December/January cuz I was in vacation



fair



I used to play hidden from her but then I can't pay 100% attention cuz I have to be aware if she's nearby



I think I'll do it anyway tomorrow



lel

nice



very nice



NOICE



man i wanna play the rest of the game bro can i just get a consistent fast 50 pleaseeeeeeeee



ive spent like 6+ hours on 50 so far total



Man imma be honest, when I train 50 a lot and don't get I just start doing runs



It magically works in the runs



Just do 100 good runs and pray one of them hits it. That's the move



Obviously sometimes I die and lose the run



i probably will since i actually wanna



yknow



play gur



Towny spitting fax



UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH



im having 100% consistency with wall kicks



literally just did 20 in a row



40 now



happens



63 in a row



what the fuck



you will fail 63 in a row after that



Can relate



woa



2:31 21-50



literally popped off



wouldn't that be like, 3:3x assuming i get 58 or lower in 1-20?



2:31 21-50 is veryyyy good



nearly wr pace



i literally like



went for every wk and hsg imaginable for fun



2:31? Man that's like 3:45 pace



(INCLUDING 45)



and got them all



thats a stunt im never doing again ever



no lycro he said 2:31 21-50



that's insane



45 skip :POGGERS:



im puzzled on how i did that



legit



went for every swinghop imaginable for fun



world record has a 2:25.5



WAIT WUT



DAMN BOE



I saw 2:31 and related to 1-40



i mean dignity if you did 45 hsg w/ no practice that is insane



i think the first couple sessions i tried 45 hsg i didn't get it at all



i really wish i recorded it tbh



o yeah im also prettty sure i got 3.92/3.90 49



now i cant get 45 hsg



Maboe Dig improving faster than light



gonna skip 3:5x, 3:4x, 3:3x and 3:2x and get 3:17 first run



:pogu:



o btw



how swinghop



so



you get a longer than max grapple



then hold down the frame before you left go



Longer than max distance grapple 
Press down and release grapple a frame after



did it



jkjk lmao



kinda hard ngl



I don't think kinda represents its difficulty enough :LELW:



i wanna stream but



massive background noise



Turn off mic



yeah but stream is infinitely better with mic



Yeah, it is



parents going to sleep in a bit anyways so stream once they leave :)



LETSOGOOOGOG



imma try and beat gur with no speedrun strats



That's called Arcanod%



Wks, HSGs and fast50 are not allowed



ill stream it



gonna be lag tho



this sucks



i do arcanod% except for fast50



im doing decent so far



and 22 skip



and except for 22 skip

Why are we always so pessimistic when a new strat happens



Makes me feel like swinghops will be free in the future



possible, but hardly achieveable



swinghops are worse because they're unpredictable in multiple ways



its really hard to get a longer than max grapple and its harder to get the frame perfect input at the right time



cant wait for this to be pinned in late 2021



hi guys in late 2021



never said we would never go for them in RTA



just that it would be stupid hard



and much worse than wks



this ones really confusing to me because im almost positive i had a 4.2x at that point in time



ah you see its the date formatting



thats really the 5th of movemtober



its actually the 2020th month of 17 AD



ah shit



checkmate



man my iinternet sucks rn



guys i think i broke the record for fastest sub 4



5 days



grats oin the sub 4 dig



lycro v3 :pogu:



I took months KEKW



WKEK



how



months kekw



maboe dig got in the server in 01/11



and in 02/03 already got a sub4



only play twice a week does not help your consistency :LELW:



I mean



I went 1.5 weeks without any progress



I didn't play GUR constantly at the start too



i mean



you got it fast af grats!



if you count inactive stuff then it took just under  a month



but if its just pure gur days



5/6 days



noice!



hhaaoooopppapaaaa...... NOICE



Bazinga



I just got a call on me phone saying there's "illigal activity on out WiFi" I swear scammer think everyone was born yesterday

Agreed, still waiting for my money



I'll be rich when he gets to his throne again

Holy shit this man is wise af

Yoo it's the same as mine



Do you use tactile or linear switches?



linear



cherry reds



yo @SensualPudding how'd you make the .exe look like that



like how'd you make it look like that kind of window



What exactly do you mean?



one sec



Looks like a normal window no?
Like the windows curtain?



like my game looks like this

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806599964222291968/unknown.png



how did you make your game have an icon and look so different



Yo that's from your pfp



indeed



Aaaa, well I used Air to make an installer. Then I can launch it as its a exe instead of launching the swf



is there a tutorial or so to make it like that?



Probably, I have no clue
Tbh I don't remember exactly what to do. I mostly just copy paste my old files nowadays.

Try searching a bit on how to use flash develop and Adobe air and get a launcher etc



@SensualPudding i found this, does this work and if it does, whats the application.xml part

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806615419720433684/unknown.png



Hmmm, maybe. Try it out
xml can be used for like licencing and stuff I think. Like if you have a part with version number and author etc.
Don't know if that's what this is though



well dont i need to link the swf or some shit



Yes, the swf will need to be with the files



ok uh bear with me since im a complete trash beginner



how do i put the swf with the files



i dont understand what you meant by that exactly



i know how to compile but im stuck at this one part



still there?



ok then



Sorry, maybe you don't need the swf
I have it under assets but when I think about it i think it's not needed

This is my folder btw if you wanna know

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806617817105039380/application.xml



wait so if i dont need the swf



what do i need



I'm totally stupid now
I have used the swf, it is needed
Just calls on it in the asconfig file as you see at the top
the output

I'm sorry if i'm a bit confused, haven't really done this for a while

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806618259469500426/asconfig.json



I use the swf but i mean you got the source code so I don't think its technically needed



uh



ok so lets start from the beginning since im kinda confused



all i have as of rn is the code i linked above



It's a lil confusing
But if you have flash developer it's a bit easier
It does all the hard work for you



that code?



yes



https://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS789ea67d3e73a8b22388411123785d839c-8000.html



so i download FlashDevelop?



Yeah, that's the flash developer tool I use at least



Then I think you need flex SDK as well, that part I'm unsure of though



i have flash develop and flex sdk rn



and yea i do need it to compile



i have it



I think that should work

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806622589106520123/Packing_App.zip



Otherwise I have no clue



ok what do i do with this



i have flashDevelop open



download it, unpack it. I included some instructions



Think it should work
Thats how I pack GUR at least



my source?



wdym my source



oh like game source?



yeah the source code of the game



not sure if its public



i have the ffdec of it tho



as in



i can open it in ffdec and see everything and shit



ffdec should work as long as it works in flash develp




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806624119373955082/unknown.png



theres ffdec ^



need to copy it over so you have it in your files, then make a .as3proj from it with flash develop



Just so you can edit it and compile it



ffdec doesn't really work with the whole edit and compile etc. it's very strange



ffdec is strange indeed



im trying to move it and it keeps freezing ffdec



yeah it's kinda shitty
I had to rewrite the entire thing in flash develop

file for file CTRL C, CTRL V

very annoying



wait what



so do i need to do that too



I did it because I changed all the variables too so it would be easier to understand. ffdec does some weird things
Like
int(int(int(int))))

I don't think you need to do it
I just did it so it would be easier to read in the future



so can i just select everything and ctrl c ctrl v\



should be doable



otherwise try to copy paste one folder at a time, shouldn't take long if that works



nothing is happening



then I don't know



ill figure it out



thanks though



Wish I could be to more help
Hope it works out for you though



ok uh



i got it to work using export all parts



but theres a lot of stuff being exported



so it might take a minute



@SensualPudding exported but there's no bat i sight

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806632993434632282/unknown.png



Have to create one yourself



k



i dont understand this rn



```2. Configuration

    - edit 'bat\SetupSDK.bat' for the path to Flex SDK (defaults should be ok)


3. Creating a self-signed certificate:

    - run 'bat\CreateCertificate.bat' to generate your self-signed certificate,

    (!) wait a minute before packaging.
```



So you just edit the setupsdk.bats path so it knows where the flex sdk is



this is why i never bothered doing air shit



so much work



where is setupsdk.bats lel



here's my flex

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806635742587387914/unknown.png



Should be in the files i sent you



o



wait so



do i like



put it in the flex sdk folder



No,
Make a new folder in your source code called 'bat'
Then copy paste all files I sent you in there



ohh



ok



ddone



Now you can follow the instructions and it should work



kk



oh

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806636751124299816/unknown.png



what\



So like, right click and edit the sdk bat first



why is that happening when i launch createcertificate



Because it can't find the flex sdk



I think



Otherwise you can Prolly skip the certification maybe



shouldnt be a hard fix then



wait so



what do i run on flashdevelop\



it just says run from flashdevelop as usual



The project

So like to edit the file you have to make a project and use it as a compiler

Just like you would with like eclipse and java for example
Or Jetbeans or whatever your perfered java compiler is



uh confession



i dont really compile shit



i just code on javascript every once in a while



what is the file i have



like a bit more specific



Oh
Well go in on flash develop and tell it where the sdk is so it can compile
Then you create a new project and copy in all files. Then you can do a test compile to see



a new AS3 project?



Yeah



If its written in as3
GUR is



ok it is



i made a new project



do i like, ctrl c everything in my folder with the source and paste it in flashdev?



Should work. Don't know though



correct screen right?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806639232377552967/unknown.png



Yes



One second before you paste



Let me check something that might be a lil easier



Need to go to my computer



This is my project file
Could prolly just like paste this with your source and replace the necissary information and the program will fix it

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806640256971177995/GURTrainer.as3proj



But now when I'm looking at it it might be easier just to create a new project and copy paste and try
up to you



question



is pasting like



just copying the folders in my source and going to flashdev and doing ctrl v?



Yeah
I don't know if it works or not, never done it so have to experiment a bit with that



ok so i opened gurtrainer.as3proj



it opened my downloads folder in files



what



wait



not infiles



i meant



in project



2 options rn

1. You try to create a new project in flash developer and copy paste files to see if it works

2. Take the .as3proj file I sent. Move it to your source folder. Like the same level as all the folders is at. Then open the .as3proj file in atom or notepad and change the addresses etc that needs to be changed.

Option 2 takes a lil bit more knowlage but don't know if 1 works, maybe



I mean 1 def works but haven't done it before so don't know how you would do it



what is happening rn



u guys making 4.0 or something?



lel no



sensual is babysitting me on how to make an air installer for .swfs using flashdevelop



o cool

agreed ice



im guessing you mean build



No no no
This is not the nerds natural habitat. Usually we sit alone in a basement coding and sweating



Yeah build sorry

Dignity: whooo I'm gonna have to walk away for a minute I'm sorry BDJDHDBDJ FUCK



LMAO true



theres the .as3proj edited by me



Wtf are u Trying to do



hack the government



Hm, looks good to me
Don't know what's wrong

Try method 1 otherwise



If u wanna feel like a hacker then just go into cookie clicker, inspect element, go into the console and type in "game. Cookies=99999999



All this work just to get a thinner windows curtain bar



Yul get infinaye cookies



That's one he'll of a hack though



doesnt paste



Ik it's an intentional game feature but



Makes me feel smart



:6head:



Sorry can't help you then
Have to try around a lot to make a project to work



The next run was a 3:25.42 after 49 (I did terrible on 50 tho)



Well, I don't think it's intentional, just not prevented
Like inspect elements is just editing the code



maybe the flex is wrong



Maybe



here's my flex

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806651432785936384/unknown.png



should look completely fine



But there's multiple ways to preform that hack and u get an achievement if u dk that



I've tried it with other sites like kahoot but no result



I'm no coder tho



The flex itself look fine
Pro tip though. Move it somewhere out of downloads so you won't loose it



I realised ystrday that I've been downloading literally everything to me ssd drive /:



I mean it should work on all websites as long as you change local sruff
Like you can change text and colour for example on all websites. Kahoot would have the awnsers on a server though so no work



wait



maybe my flex is kinda old

Flex💪



I think it's the project that's bad but maybe
I mean it should launch with a bad flex as well



Or maybe flex is just not the sdk you need to use
I have so many sdks I have forgotten
Thought it were flex though



how does your gur folder look

do i need the xml and the json



Yeah you do. At least for a build

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806653195342184488/unknown.png



so thats why



I've sent you both I think



I'm assuming that u can find the game files in appdata



Right?



I think it's ffdec that fucked it up though



Some game files are in appdata yes



I wanna make custom sprites



so this should look perfectly fine

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806653474388443136/unknown.png



Most notably GURTrainer files as well as minecraft screenshots



For the game files



all the source files + the as3proj + xml + json



To be fair I don't know the first thing about coding so I shouldn't mess with it but I kinda wanna



shouldnt be missing anything



I'll make a backup folder



Edit the xml and json to work as well
But think the flash develop would do that automatically
Don't think those files are the problem



@icecube5011 what exactly do you want to do?
Like custom levels are entirely custom shiz?



i kinda dont want my game to be called GURTrainer so i will edit lol



is this important'

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806654185075769374/unknown.png



like



do i change src/Main.as orrr



I mean yes. That tells the program where to start

But as I said I don't think it matters if you have the xml or not. Flash develop will make one for you when you compile



do i change it then?



I think you should delete the xml as well as the json
Then try to fix the problem

Can always try with xml later if it doesn't work. But that's not the problem rn



it uh



doesnt make a .xml



or a .json



Well does it compile?



it fails to



Then it can't make a xml or json




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806655352966873128/unknown.png



Xml and json is just something the program makes to keep track of all the info



a target file must be specified?



what does that mean



It means that the program has absolutely 0 clue where to start to compiling. Doesn't know how to write



how fix



Hmmm, idk



sounds good



I don't know where it wants you to specify
Either it's the as3proj file or it needs to be specified in the flash develop itself



Or maybe you can do a xml and json to fix but I think it will be annoying af because you don't really know all the vatiables



OH



i think i get it



src/Main.as doesnt exist and its set to compile there



This
GURTrainerConfig. What is that?



wdym



Oh yeah, that would definitely be the case



see i have a few iq points



so im guessing it needs to compile to a .as file



Well it needs to know the starting point. Where the main file is



ok so if i dont have a main file



do i have to like



create one



No no no
Don't create one

But a game must have like a parent file

The main method
The one that calls on everyone else



ohh



What files is under the 'scripts' folder?



so i gotta find that method



its massive but there's a few 'main's in there

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806657373270966313/unknown.png



Yeah I have no clue
I really do think ffdec has made it real hard
Like looks like you got it all but some things are Prolly wrong names and positions



I mean maybe it is one of those main but doubt it



wont hurt to try



trial and error time



That's the spirit



I mean like 100% GURTrainer is tail and error

Didn't know anything about programming before I started it. So it's all like a big mess



YOOOOO

So it compiled successfully?



yes



no errors



And can you run it as well?



idk where the actual file is



For now it isn't packaged so can only run from the compiler



ok so



how run



test project?



Try




{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806659046891192380/unknown.png



Our you can skip it and try to package it directly



Ahhhh, so time for the xml now
Guess compiling didn't care one then
Shit



oof



no json?



like do i not use the json you gave me



since it didnt give me a json error



You can use the ones I sent you but you'll have to change the text manually and I'm not sure what they should be replaced with



ok

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/806659676284256317/unknown.png



new error



Hmmm, don't know where that comes from
Isn't application 28.0 the current GURTrainer? Thought so

So that shouldn't be out on the Adobe website



so do i change the number to something lower or some shit



No I mean i don't think the URL exists at all
Don't know what you should do



You know I really have to go to bed
Have Exams in a couple of hours and need some sleep



yeah for sure go sleep



You'll have to experiment on your own for some time. But I'll be back tomorrow if you need something

Hope it has worked itself out though

weirdchamp (2) 


play gur with only sound on, no music, i t sounds weird



Lol noobs they don't even do 22 skip, which is one of the fundamental strats that make up a modern Give Up, Robot speedrun. On average this trick will save you about 3 seconds over the old method, shown here. Now, the new method. So, the main goal is to slide between these two spinners. It's a pixel perfect gap, so it needs to be lined up using this block. Let's start with the fundamentals. There are 4 blocks that make up this platform, each will fall independently when touched. The procedure in this trick is to jump over the firs

i found an interesting thing



not useful but fun



the moving platforms in 23 and 32 dont need to active when robot steps on them



they active if his hitbox is in their vicinity



so robot doesnt need to touch the platforms to move



just have his hitbox be in their vicinity and be grounded



just a fun thing i found



so the platform can go up before youre standing on it ?



yes



as long as the rightmost pixel of robot's hitbox is touching the platform



well not the platform specifically



lemme record



a thing



so basically it registers diagonal contact as contact



interesting

???



you're on the platform



of course it goes up



i meant



his sprite wasnt on the platform



you dont see him touch it



yeah but the right most edge of his sprite is over it



so evidently his hitbox is just a square



yeah ik



thats why i said it was just a fun discovery



not really useful in any sense



i thought you meant it more like you can activate the platform while you arent on it



funny strat

This shits free as hell



bruh



going for 15 rn



if theres 1 swinghop thats maybe viable rta its 16



I've gotten it about 5 times



usually get a mid 2 second, so I think my first one was actually a stroke of luck. 2.03!



i tried earlier and never got it but to be fair i only tried for like 5 minutes before i got bored



I got the first after 7 minutes lel



helps if you hold down



and just try to release the grapple on the right frame



just got 15 lel



.01 off TAS



im pretty sure evry noob in existence has done that and thought it was faster



its not slow



but 20 skip is so easy if u play it safe



if you play it safe it can be slower than 4.8



aswell as the the 30 top grapple



o



im literally less than 10 seconds away from bopping you



pretty sure you cant call me a noob

how hard you describe swinghops to be?



now that you actually tried them?



definitely not run viable, but feasible for ILs for sure



in the 45 minutes I streamed the attempts, I maybe achieved swinghops 10 times



and only half of those were strong enough to work



oh, thats cool to hear, the segmented time will go down by a little more hehe



@LycroP2 r u gonna watch the match?

na pretty sure it just said 21 next to the server icon



Oh



Sry again, I was bored and wasent thinking from ur point of veiw



Won't happen again lul



It's bad



well im debating watching the show i was watching or actually practice



and yeah i dont really care about the race so ill just go watch the show cya



Cya



man idk why, even tho the .exe runs smoother than the swf file, it keeps having some lag spikes



like, from time to time my game freezes por 0.5 secs



Gur 2 on swf dosent even work for me



It crashed when u grapple onto the power generator thing



for me the .exe just keeps having some lag spikes idk why



That's weird



like, it runs 60 fps but then frozes for half a second



like, every minute or so



That must be annoying



yeah it is



When ur trying to hsg then suddenly *LAGSPIKE*



I doubt it's ur pc



Maybe delete and reinstall



probably is your computer, i haven't had anything like that



but like icecube said a reinstall is a good idea



I'm reinstalling it



but i dont think its my pc



cuz it runs fine



but then lagspike



why would that make it not your pc



could be temps getting too high then throttling your fps



yeah, but it stays on 60 constantly



but idk, may be it



bun I dont think so



my laptop runs it fine :KEKW:



I'm also on a laptop :YEPsad:



Maybe get a new coolers



Get a new cpu cooler if ur on a laptop



Wait do laptops have cpu coolers



uh yes



Hmm then maybe consider replacing it



If its an Intel cooler then that probably the problem if its to do with cooling



I reinstalled the exe now its fine

got 3.52



wow tied it\



lmao



3.45



3.43



probably as far as i can go



im surprised with my consistency at 22wk tbh



3.38 yooo



the 3.3x



niceeeee



i would guess your probably losing time on the ending



it's annoying to get right and the spinner is kinda rng



~the ultimate flex~

ping me at 8am one more time i fucking dare you



@Towny @merpell cheese



there is something strange that can happen with blocks you wake up that I haven't been able to record



I woke up the small block on 36 by standing on it to grapple the top block, missed the end so I decided to wallkick back because why not



the small block was still on the screen but in a different y position



I have not yet been able to replicate it



I've also had it happen a while ago with 50



huh which swf were you on



did it fall completely off the screen by the time you had reached the right side?



it must have



I think I am losing my mind



gur trainer 2.0



are you sure you didn't go for "fast" 36 and simply forgot that you didn't touch the block?



it was in a different spot



maybe though



I'm leaning to believe I'm insane over some weird game stuff



so where was the block? lower or higher than usual?



lower



but still on screen?



like, falling?



it was still



I didn't try interacting with it or anything because I thought about it after I reset



how close to the bottom



edit us a mockup image got damn it



I will attempt to get it on recording for a bit tomorrow



WTFWTFWTF



I GOT 3.17



ON 22



I FUCKING GOT 3.10



HOLY FUCK IM INSANEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE



welp



i gotta download 2.0 now



holy shit that's crazy



I thought you mean 3m17s lol



yeah before he said on 22 i was like wtf how



good job m8



dignity post video :pOg:



3.13



gg



recorded



thats nice



good



wr?



yes



but



im going for 3.0x



:pogu:



ihook the spinner at the end to go even faster



oooo wait i forgot abt the sensual grapple



she's kidding right?



that isnt rta viable right?



ihooks are rta viable



well it is kinda



but idk about 22



just a pain



would be really hard



o but @Dignity  are you doing the grapple in the middle after the wallkick



no?



you probably should try it



the TAS does it and it's not terrible and saves some time



idk why i wasn't doing it before



how do i evne do it



i hooks are dumb  but not too bad



man the beginning wk is killing my fingers

hm35?



tied wr



who thinks that gur 2 has more effort into it?



They probably just had more time to make it than the first



the first was made for a game jam iirc



first was made during a gamejam wasnt it



or at least the prototype was



and they wanted to make it more fleshed out



bosses, coins, worlds, more levels



ok i cant beat 3.13



C:omegalul:INS



trying to make it like an actual game less like a prototype



its too optimized mannnnnnnnnn



tied 17 and 35 wr but im too lazy to upload them



if they kept the movement the same and tried to make levels that experiment with it it could have been good



grappling in gur2 isnt the same



Anyone gonna try to contest 15 or 16? I wanna see some swinghops, boys



no :)



no swinghops suck ass



but aren't u buttmad that I beat your 16 by like a whole second



i tried 16 for like  two minutes



is a swinghop just    grapple, hold down, let go of grapple and hope you get it ?

i mean



if i cant beat towny by a frame in 49



what hope do i have



ok fuck you guys for taking me off my shsow



back to show



Man someone took back the level 18 record



Sad



hasn't vicckey had that record for months?



you should submit to the src leaderboard



Wait my run got taken down



tf?



uhhhhhhhhh



@merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell @merpell



Oh wait



maybe it was on the wrong version



what up



I was on gur trainer 3.0



That's why



yup, gotta be on 2.0



*pain*



or 1.0 if you're a reasonable human being



I'll spend another half an hour trying to get it back eventually



oh right, that's the one I use



2.:omegalul:



wait 2.0 was the first exe right?



2.0 is not an exe no



3.0 is the exe



oh



oh right, 2.0 had some bugs with it



2.0 is the buggy mess



Where is the download?



we really should take 2.0 off SRC



or... well nvm



cause it has a reset button



which 1.0 doesn't

SUB 4:05:051



lets goo



Ill get a sub 4 once I learn 43 skip



and get consistent with it



finnaly did 43 skip



with the help of rtdrtd67s video



rdt



trd



drt



dtr



43 skp has too much precision for me



theres gonna be a sub 4 soon



do it



I predict copycat will get the sub four in june



I predict copycat will get the sub four in february



Place your bets here, folks!



Once  I perfect 43 hsg its sub 4



you def dont need 43 hsg to sub 4



it doesnt even save that much, like 1second



nah it's closer to 2



so not that much time



sub 4 begins now



you should though because its easy



I just started doing it so not really easy rn



but Ill practice

I don't play with A cuz I don't wanna sink my A key too, cuz I play a lot of games on WASD so ya know



Im thinking about doing a AHK to change the Z key to X but I ain't having any problems with it by now

He said something before?



Or gave more details on it?



nope that was it i think it's pretty clearcut



i watched some of the vids and it's just a compilation of short clips of speedrunners



Yeah, I watch EZ compilations



Even tho it can bring some traffic into the game



yah i rly hope it does



some fraction of the estimated 40k ppl have to see the clip and be interested right?



thats worst case actually



lots of them have 70k plus views



plus the smb1 record just got broken so



It'll certainly make some people be like:

Yo is that the quick flash robot game from 2010



i mean



sm63 got featured on ezscape and we got nearly nothing from that



i wouldnt be hopeful



theres always hope



:Sadge:



It doesn't hurt right



yeah it doesnt



But there's still hope!



just pretty trash when you inevitably get dissapointed



at least dont keep your hopes too high



maybe featuring an actual good flash game will gain publicity :omegalul:

It’s so fun! It helps insult people on CoD for sure. You can only do someone’s mom so many times.



“Whatever, you play with legos!” “You probably masturbate in church!” One kid in my group specializes in these insults.

the gur 2 tab... channel... idk wtf theyre called



@SensualPudding would it be possible to make playing gur a discord status



idk how any of it works tho



pretty sure you can add it yourself



in discord settings



Yes it most definitely would. I don't really know how you code it into GUR but don't think it's too hard
Otherwise you can just make a custom rich presence, like I've done currently



yeah or that, can just add a game. but then it'll show up like a status almost



how?



user settings > game activity



oh ok



oh yh then you can change the name of the game ur playing



u can get creative so it says playing: pornhub



it works!



bro



you can do that since like



the start of discord



like I used to do that a lot back in 2016



and 2017



basically till custom statuses



im always late to the party



i fucking hate 42 and 43



i could have got best in da world under 16 if it werent for those



Pogchampion

insane demons are easy for me

hard demons are like a 1 day thing



and medium/easy demons are like a 30min - 1 hour thing



actually not all hard demons take me a day



I beat 3 hard demons in a single day lol



some take me a day



some take me a few hours



best ive done is beat impact x in 15 mins



but its rly easy



best I've done is beat Hyperyard (hard demon yes it's harder than NC) in 18 attempts

This level isn't very good, the song is fucking horrendous too. I have no idea how this is even rated LUL

However, it's an really easy insane demon so I'll take it

but I'm too lazy to beat an actual hard insane demon



That's the only hard demon I've done



ok uh

Looks ez ik



There is a rly hard straightfly after the ufo tho



"really hard"



I have 42-100 on cata

anyways it's an extreme demon



that has a a lot of straight fly



Oh cataclysm

unless you have a 144hz+, cata not ez



Thattophobia is so dark



Whenever I watch it I can't see shit

neet means not employed, enlisted, or in training

the sadness of being a wagecuck will come one day, its what they say



or sorry, not in education, employed, or in training



Im using that sweet sweet bitcoin money



I didn't even apply for stimulus lmao



in some countrys people live like that



do u actually have crypto money



yh he sbeen messing with it since 2009



towny must've earned loads of money when bitcoins exploded



richest man alive



yea, I would mine bitcoin back when it was worth like under 100 dollars a coin



I MINE DIAMONDS



i missed out on bitcoin entirely because i was too young to mine or buy it



i wanted to



towny r u gonna buy 10 3080 tis for more bitcoin



make a mining rigggg



You can mine when you're young. I was in high school



i was in elementary school



i did not have a gpu



is elementry like primary



towny sometimes forget he's almost double of our age



first 6 ish years of school



yep



yh thats primary



the reason why i went for pc is cos idk how to use a ps or xbox sooooooooooooo



why tf is it called elementary



what akickass name



because its foundational



shut up dweev



you learn all your basics



baldi teaches u



duh



in brazil we divide schools years like this: 2 infant years, 9 elementary years and 3 high school years



all i learned in elementary school was how to scam people on neopets and browse internet forums



ours are 5 elementary, 3 middle, 4 high school



wtf thats so odd compared to the uk



or 6 2 4 for some



I'm on the 1st high school year rn (freshman) and they gave me 1st elementary grade online books :Pepega:



what place in the usa has 6 grade as elementary?



uk does



all 4 places I've lived



uk is not in the USA I'm pretty sure



lemme check



oh ffs



ºoº



dont take the mick



yeah, definitely not in the USA



brit schooling makes no sense to me



what does sixth form mean



I don't remember the younger kids books having so much drawings



wtf are grammar schools



OH FOR FUCK SAKE IT MAKES SENSE



what are a levels



what are gcses



it does, but when I was in it there were less



so the 11+ is an exam that u do in yr 6 if u pass u go to a grammer school which is like a smartass school



but thats like 9 years ago so



i dident mean to reply



oop



I just reply when there's some message in the middle of the conversation

i managed to beat gur without ajustng grapple. the three exepions were 43, 45 and 50



wow thats a great idea



i think 43 is def possible, just will need some work, was trying rn and its kinda tricky



45 too



idk bout 50 tho



i just did 43 without ajustments



noice



no ajusting grapple should be a src catagory



no



u



bris



tf?



i wanna speedrun gur without ajusting grapple



would be a fun chllenge



we need to sort 45 and 50 yet



didnt try those yet



i managed to get to the last pillar of 50



YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



wut



so its def possible to do the end



ye



43 is possible



only 45 to go



u just need to do a weird route for 43#



the problem is that the obsticles get longer and it appears that the apace gets tighter



got to the end of 45



where you grapple the block that rises



nice!



but didnt pass



:Sadge:



cuz of like 2cm ;-;



man 50 is hard



co u need to do fast 50



i was thinking cos its so hard to get the the last pillar we could think of a way to merge fast 50 and block 50



block 50 for end and fast for beggining



:6head:



passed 45



its ez af tho



just get a medium sized grapple



ah ok



at the start



ok



i just discovered a major glitch!



ill try it later when my class end



50 looks hard af



say it



for some reason gur started copying my way of doing 50 like a replay idk if its supposed to be in the game but still



and i know for a fact it wasent the tas



it was my way of doing 50



:pogu:



progress

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/809400726564372510/Picture1_3.png



if you press t it runs a tas file



if you dont have any



it saves your inputs



so thats why its copying u



oh :KEKW:



you mustve pressed t without notcing it



probs



YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



im starting to think the last pillars impossible



if you grapple the back of the 2nd pillar than the 3rd i think you'll pass



very precise tho



@rtdrtd67 possible?



yh



speedrunning it would be hard af



I'm doing every level just to see, and until now 18 was the hardest yet



very precise



yh



u need to get a medium grapple



quite annoying



I'm jumping with x just to be sure



lel



im sure all are possible til 50



unless i accidently hit up



would recommend jumping with x so you dont decrease your grapple unintentionally



i dont like jumping with x but ya know



if i were to speedrun it i would unkeybind my- o wait



thats rly annoying



rules: you're not allowed to press arrow up or down



simple



x is shit tho:YEPsad:



even tho nobody cares for this challenge



tru



I know :YEPsad:



but its the right way so we dont break the rules by accident



yeah



agreed



actually ctrl would be a good key to keybind



its reachable



o wait



wait yh it is!



@SensualPudding is it possible to delete the grapple ajust code



if thats how it works



lmao



man just jump with x



its not that annoying



i-.... i cant....:YEPsad:



i cant do it!!!!:YEPsad:



you can do it!



really its fine



and then u cant press z with ur index finger



meh ill get used to it



I wont reprogram something for a small thing like this that prolly will die out soon sorry
Just use X for jump



fair enough



otherwise just rebind X to like left ctrl or something



thats what I thought  lmao



am i allowed to say that 50 is impossible



ik, its quitter talk but IDUNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



can someone summon rtd?



not yet



let the guy sleep

i summoned him



DONT SUMMON RTD AT 3AM *GONE WRONG* *GONE SEXUAL* *AT 3AM* *VERY SCARY*



WAIT IS IT NIGHT FOR HIM?



playing without grapple adjustments feels like when I started playing GUR



oop caps



its like 7:50 for him rn



lol same



o shit



so stiff



sorry! if ur reading this rtd!:weirdchamp:



cos u juist panic and boom



me sister played gur the other day and that exact thing happned to her

can u show me the KEKW emote ive never seen it

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



do not choke it



i choked it.........



you joking right?



i wish i was



DAMMIT :YEPsad:



WE'RE CLOSE BOES



first i gotta find out if the last part is possible



idk if the grapple is long enough



if its not possible the way you're doing



you can graplpe the 2nd one



than instantly the 3rd



so youre high enough



very VERY precise



thats insane



exactly



maybe if i grapple the top of the last pillar instead of inside i can push myself further



thats my idea



o



.



i thought u were talking abouts sensuals il



if you have an easier way of doing it



say it pls cuz this is insane rn



dumb that statement down for my tiny brain



~~Single swing the last 3 pillars~~



lol



ez clap



I have no clue wtf this means



u always broke body parts as a kid



and hes drunk



fair



drunk + injury = cser and towny merged



F in chat



I just read some replies in towny's comment where a guy said the game becomes boring and repetitive starting in 40



Which imo is where are some of the cooler levels



the whole game is boring and repetitive



change my mind



Oh shoot



except for hard 10 ofc



40 is where the game stops geting repetitive



H10 best level in the game



40 is where literally every level changes from any level before it



Like



You could say some levels are just mirrors like 5 and 14, 23 and 32 ok, even tho they get harder, so I don't agree with that opinion



17 and 27



And imo, even tho 11-20 is kinda of a """"boring"""" cutscene for speedruns, I think they're great levels for a causal playthrough

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688951042498363415/809486798266957864/hugepanic.png



Cuz you get the hang of the grappling hook



Interesting take



Yep, that's the comment



Which I completely disagree



its interesting because its a bad take



KEKW



:KEKW:



plot twist: he never actually beat the game



well yea he got stuck on 49



I mean, if he had so much problem in 49 I wouldn't be surprised if he had quit in 50 :KEKW:



49 is not even hard the first time you play it though



there's like a half second window



Yep



49 is a more a cool lvl than hard



how do you get stuck on 49



It's a level that you play and get like: wow look  how far this can throw me



I'll be honest here



I got stuck at 48



When I played my first time



i did too because i tried to use the block



Yeah



I was like wtf how man



i get stuck on 48 to this day



😔

YEPsad (4)

This video is from the guy who has WR in celeste classic



Lol



What a coincidence



Tru



But getting stuck at 49 damn



> the swinging physics are DOGSHIT though
got that right



you can actually get an omega HSG if you do that on 48



its fun



at least smh



also is that on the ezscape video



yup



well it got one guy to publicly try it at least



if they didnt like 41-50 theyre gonna despise the ufo levels in gur2 so rip



:KEKW:



I am having the worst runs of my life



can relate



what is sub 4 pace for 40 levels?



2:30-2:40



2:40 +-



my 3:57 had a 2:37 1-40 and I died like 8 times in 41-50 so yeah



I think even a high 2:4x is sub4able



personally my 41-50 gold is a 1:06



so theoretically a 2:53 could sub4 for me



depends how good you are at 41-50



I like how when I do 43 skip first try I choke 46 skip



I'd highly recommend doing it like rtd shows in his tutorial



where you wait a little on the last block till you are farther to the right



loses like .4 but its like 60% more consistent



mine's a 1:11 i think



is it just me or when im about to get a pb I can feel my heart beating



I feel that too



I felt it the most on my 3:57 for sure



I feel it when I get a good time for 40 levels



now I only got that feeling past 48



same



only past 46 and then i start getting nervous



i only get nervous past 48 cuz I know I may get rekt by 48 by pure bad luck



i get nervous cuz i KNOW im gonna get fucked by 48



:LELW:



i get nervous at 46 on pace bc i suck at 46



I get mega nevouse on 50



best way to not get nervous playing gur is to not play gur



I never thought of that



but if you do decide to play the game



K imma be gon for like 1 min



telling yourself the run sucks and youre just continuing for practice helps me



klice with the big boy strats



coz  I need to finish 10 more levels



yea i just play the mental game



even if its a lie



try and think about something else and tell myself its a shit run



ye



I do it for practive



i feel like sometimes i'm so focused that I don't realize it's a good run until i get to 48-50



choked a run with the 3 pillars on 50



maboe rtd getting in the flow state



oof



its way worse when you lose it to 50hsg

what is @merpells pfp from?



its so sad when you find a image you like a lot and its 300x300 :pepehands:



is that from the super mario bros 3 show



is it from the super show



it looks like it



I thought the super show was the live action one where bob hoskins went "ay fuck you luigi"



you could try a website that uses ai to make images higher res



the super show is an animated thing that has live action bits at the start and end of the episodes



smh not a true fan

what who pinged me

lol



I can confirm



sucks



not only once :LELW:



do you know that feeling when you tought something was hard af but you're just doing it the wrong way?



that's how I'm feeling with a lot of screens in farewell



I used to do them in retarded ways



now doing it again I see that they were much easier



still hard



but less hard than what I tought before



ive watched a lot of streams of blind fw playthroughs



cuz now I'm seeing the right way of doing it



sometimes its painful watching them try a bad solution for 20 minutes



I did that a lot ;-;



and they never realize that maybe something else would work better



"why is this so tight??"



It must've been painful



> its not



its kind of funny



exactly



fucking exactly



klice is a wise man



there are some screens that I legit lost 40 minutes to way back then



that I passed in like 5 tries



There wasnt alot of fries left and my grandpa said "pog"



grandpog



holy ur grandpa is pogchampion



Im going to show what you do



NOOOOO DONT EXPOSE ME



IM GOING TO DO IT



I will leak it bro

@LycroP2 i thought of a method for ajustless 50



activate block, fast 50 to last pillar then grapple onto the block when its in reach and is approching the last bit



:6head:



would one swinging yourself through the last pillars be easier with the block?



cuz if it is



may be possible



what is ajustless 50?



Yesterday ice suggested trying to beat the game without adjusting your grapple



50 is the only level remaining



I didn't try yet



But all the other ones are possible



Yeah its definitely possible but that sounds hard as fuck lol



I know its possible



but it must be hard af



ice got to the last pillar



but he said he couldnt get close enough to the lineup of blocks of the end



I didnt try yet cuz im not on my pc



the only two real hard levels are 43 and 50



this does not apply to you, since you play on controller (:KEKW: ) but the rules are that you cant press up or down during the whole playthrough, for simplicity sake



so you gotta jump with X

how did u pass the last pillars?

i kinda did ur technique



def, a super important challenge :YEPsad:



i got a grapple outside the pilarr



everyone willl care and it wont die in a week



:YEPsad:



:YEPsad:



o well im proud and its a fun challenge



could you record how u did 43? my way of doing it is very inconsistent



i dident do 43



u did



no, i did 45



thats why its grilledice AND lycro present



o 433



u said u got 43 yesterday



YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO



i got 43 and 45 mixed up



sure did



u need to manuver to the first block and jump to the last few blocks



like, jump on top of the first block?



yh



u dont have to go to the top block



u can go to the middle one and swing to the top



i did it twice im pretty sure



:pogu:



did u manage to do it?



no cuz im not on my pc rn



o gocha



i still gotta find oput the exact path



all i know is u take advantage of the first block

yeah



thats a web game i knew



but more anime



ah



and anime community..:monkaS:



no offense to anime fans



its a great app, very good to use, but who uses it really scares me

Guys I'm creating a lexicon for Give Up Robot. What are some terms or tricks we often use that I can write down



I got wallkick, swinghop, hsg, ihook, towny slide, doggo 13, towny 47, 38 slam dunk, 41 hole-in-one, 48 one-swing, "pinched", the towny wait, the cyclowns hubris, and the lycro prophecy



Everybody forget swingleaps exist



But what exactly is a lexicon?



wtf is a swingleap



and a lexicon is like a dictionary for a specific niche

Holding down as releasing your grapple so you get horizontal speed



do you think maybe there's a reason everyone forgets it



The lycro prophecy will be there YAHOOOO :pogu:



Cuz we're so used to it I guess

Oh I gotta add "the bounce" and "grapple rng"

I like that if u start scrolling #general  pins from the oldest to newest ones you see how we stopped caring about what to pin or not pin



Intended%



That's a must have



Blockless and blockful 50



Also you cannot forget 22 skip, which is one of the fundamental strats that make up a modern Give Up, Robot speedrun. On average this trick will save you about 3 seconds over the old method, shown here. Now, the new method. So, the main goal is to slide between these two spinners. It's a pixel perfect gap, so it needs to be lined up using this block. Let's start with the fundamentals. There are 4 blocks that make up this platform, each will fall independently when touched. The procedure in this trick is to jump over the firs



> 48 one-swing
can be generalized to "n-swing"



applies to 29, 44 etc



to further the confusion I was gonna write "One swing 48: Also known as Two-swing or Three-swing depending on how anal retentive you are about grapple count"



could also add towny walk/jog



and hwk and limpkick if youre counting tas strats



ceiling kick and intended% are pretty self explanatory



arcanod strat isnt though



roboglue  maybe



true



also fast 1



would be self explanatory if it didnt refer to the one strat



oh cser said that



hm35 and elevator skip prob deserve spots

I'm currently playing celeste farewell and I'm on the 5th checkpoint, the one where you learn wavedashes, I think i'm what 60% into it?



idk its lenght



what is celeste



i mean, ik its a game and all but what do u do in it?



its a very hard game where you climb a mountain



from the same creator of GUR!



what a coincidence innit?



its a very very good game



would recommend u playing it



I just came here to get the files for the game that wasted too much of my time. Cool to see people that are much better than me play it though. Thanks! Also great full screen addition very nice.



I do not blame you for wasting so many hours, GUR is a great game!



hope you do well on playing it\:D



then I feel that this should be pinned



yea that's about halfway done



maybe like 40% done

oh yeah should i add osama vault



Should :allegedly: be on the lexicon?



Why not?



its not particularly relevant cus hardmode is a meme



Fax



:YEPsad:



Add "#general - a place to talk about everything, keep GUR to a minimum pls"



true



keep gur to a minimum :lul:



And add "@Speedbot - a bot that once used to work :YEPsad: "



i should fix it



i keep working on other projects



I miss speeedbot



Me too :PepeHands:



It was so good seeing him doing his best to work but always messing something up :YEPsad:



Yo should we add Sub-Taz and WORD RECORD to the lexicon?



ok most of the speedbot issues werent my fault



He just couldn't keep up with SRCs ever changing infrastructure



most were either a) merpell changed something about timing or b) src api bad



nah, it's fine, most were SRC bs



@Doggo you should add 22 skip but just copy the whole script



The *whole* script



added sub arcanod and sub taz



Noice



ill work on speedbot rn

pogu 


he basically doesnt work because he cant handle ILs at all



but ill turn him on on my vps



and see if he does anything funny

jogando wallkicks will work



me when im jogandoing



Fun fact: jogando means both playing and throwing in portuguese, use it as you will



basically the same thing



:KEKW:



This one made me laugh real hard



Good one doggo, good one



But like, you can use it as,
Playing COD
Jogando COD
Throwing the gun at floor
Jogando a arma no chão



It's so funny that every language has loads of these double words



Still don't know why z it looks like they were made this way just so you can make jokes about it

the wk at the start



imagine ceiling kick



but you dont stop



KEKW



dumbass strat



bow to dig25



lmao its even worse than 22wk



pretty much a fun strat since no sane person would even consider implementing it into runs



does that even save anything



im pretty sure it does



22wk isnt even THAT hard and it saves like 2 seconds



so



i did the exact same movement but without the wk and i got a 3.1x



> pretty much a fun strat



not one to be implemented in runs



the IL for 25 is  2.83



yeah my ending sucks ok



i was trying to show the wk at the start



makes sense



it saves like .2 on 3



so it should yeah
